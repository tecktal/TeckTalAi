It deals with vectors, matrices, and linear transformations and serves as a foundation for understanding complex mathematical concepts.</p>\n\n    <h3>Introduction to Linear Algebra</h3>\n    <p>The primary focus of linear algebra is to solve systems of linear equations. This is accomplished through the study of vectors, vector spaces, linear maps, and matrices. Understanding these key components is essential for delving deeper into the subject.</p>\n\n    <h3>Key Concepts</h3>\n    <h4>Vectors</h4>\n    <p>Vectors are quantities defined by both a magnitude and a direction. They are often represented as an array of numbers which dictates their position in space. For example, a vector in two-dimensional space can be denoted as <code>v = [v1, v2]</code>.</p>\n\n    <h4>Matrices</h4>\n    <p>Matrices are rectangular arrays of numbers arranged in rows and columns. They are useful for representing linear transformations and solving systems of linear equations. A matrix can be written as:</p>\n    <p><code>A = [[a11, a12], [a21, a22]]</code></p>\n\n    <h4>Linear Transformations</h4>\n    <p>Linear transformations are functions that map vectors to other vectors in a linear manner. They preserve vector addition and scalar multiplication operations. Understanding these transformations is crucial for applying linear algebra to real-world problems.</p>\n\n    <h4>Systems of Linear Equations</h4>\n    <p>A system of linear equations consists of multiple equations that can be solved simultaneously. These systems are commonly expressed in matrix form, facilitating efficient computation and solution finding:</p>\n    <pre>\n        Ax = b\n    </pre>\n    <p>Here, <code>A</code> is the matrix representing coefficients, <code>x</code> is the column vector of variables, and <code>b</code> is the column vector of constants.</p>\n\n    <h3>Applications of Linear Algebra</h3>\n    <p>Linear algebra is applied in various domains such as:</p>\n    <ul>\n        <li><strong>Computer Graphics:</strong> Transformation and manipulation of images and graphics.</li>\n        <li><strong>Machine Learning:</strong> Formulating models and performing calculations on large datasets.</li>\n        <li><strong>Engineering:</strong> Analyzing and modeling physical systems with differential equations.</li>\n    </ul>\n\n    <h3>Conclusion</h3>\n    <p>Understanding the basics of linear algebra sets a solid foundation for exploring more advanced topics. It provides the tools necessary for mathematical modeling, problem-solving, and dealing with complex systems in various scientific and engineering fields. As we progress through this course, we will delve deeper into each of these concepts and explore their real-world applications.</p>\n</section>",
