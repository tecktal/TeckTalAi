We are very excited to be together for the next few weeks as part of the new EdTech Policy Academy for Africa, where innovation meets education. As you know, my name is Bob Hawkins, and I am your Minister of Education at the United Republic of Learning.\n\nOur challenge at the ministry is clear: we need to foster cross-country collaboration, implement effective EdTech strategies, and explore the transformative role of new technologies such as AI. We must stay abreast of these technologies and be able to leverage them to improve teaching and learning in our classrooms. Our objectives for the ministry and our participation in this academy include tracking progress and sharing lessons learned among participants through engaging panel discussions.\n\nWe need to build upon the great work you’ve all done and ensure that everyone in our ministry is aware of it. We also need to update action plans and implement EdTech strategies with a focus on resource allocation and prioritization, because plans without action are meaningless. Lastly, we will be exploring the role of AI and other emerging trends in education, as we need to continuously innovate as a ministry.\n\nThe academy in which we will all participate will last for three weeks, with an estimated commitment of 10 to 15 hours per week. I hope all of you will be fully engaged so that we can make the most of our time together. In week one, we will come together in panel discussions on various EdTech topics inspired by the EdTech Readiness Index developed by the World Bank, as well as discuss essential elements of our vision and policy to create a resilient hybrid learning system in the United Republic of Learning. Topics will include devices and connectivity, digital skills, digital resources, system management, implementation capacity, and our vision for the School of the Future—with AI as a crosscutting theme.\n\nIn week two, country teams from across the United Republic of Learning will participate in individual meetings with instructors to work on revising or drafting their EdTech policy strategies and action plans. These sessions will focus on actionable solutions tailored to each of your needs.\n\nFinally, in week three, we’ll conclude with final presentations, sharing our knowledge across the Ministry of the United Republic of Learning, where each country team will showcase their learnings and outline next steps. These presentations will be held in both English and French to accommodate all of our colleagues across the ministry.\n\nOur engagement in the academy will be delivered online, combining synchronous and asynchronous activities on our course platform to ensure flexibility and accessibility for all participants. We want to model how our learners might experience hybrid learning themselves.\n\nRemember, in the United Republic of Learning, we are all teachers, but most importantly, we are all learners.\n\nI’m very excited about your participation in this journey to transform education through technology. Together, I truly believe we can shape the future of learning in Africa and transform our ministry at the United Republic of Learning.\n\nThank you very much, and I look forward to seeing you soon.",

I\nam part of the World Bank EdTech team, and welcome to your final presentation, which is\nsomewhat like a graduation ceremony for the 2024 EdTech Policy Academy for Africa.\nThis session, as you can see from the screen, has two segments. The first is about five\ncountries that worked on teacher skills, teacher technology, and leveraging technology for\nteacher training. These five countries will be speaking in English. After each segment, there will\nbe feedback provided by the adviser of the minister. For the first segment, it will be Barbara,\nand in the second segment, it will be Fred. After each expert review or feedback, we will have\na 20-minute Q&A session.\nWhile you listen to the interviews between the vice minister and the country or provincial\nrepresentatives within our United Republic of Learning, please post your questions in the chat.\nWe will document them and, during the Q&A, send them over to the minister. This way, she\ncan call on you. If you have any questions, feel free to put them in the chat.\nAnother thing: we have collected all your PowerPoints. However, because we have so many\ncountries participating in the current Policy Academy, we won’t be using PowerPoints. Instead,\nit will be a conversation between the country representative and the vice minister. We have\nhosted all your PowerPoints in a Google Drive. Sarah, Alex, and I will be pasting those in the\nchat. If you want to learn more about a specific country intervention, please click on those, and\nyou’ll be able to view the content.\nWith this in mind, let’s move on to our United Republic of Learning. I’m going to hand it over\nto our Minister Bob. Over to you, Minister Bob.\nMinister Bob:\nGood afternoon, colleagues. Thank you very much for coming to this All-Hands Ministry\nmeeting today. It has been an exciting three weeks, and thank you for rising to the challenge of\nthe demands we’ve received from our president to develop action plans to ensure our policy\ncan be implemented.\nI’m very excited to see all of the briefing notes you have prepared for this meeting. As Changal\nsaid, we will be sharing these among all participants. I want this to be an active discussion\naround the key topics raised by our colleagues from across the United Republic of Learning.\nPlease add questions to the chat, participate, and interrogate the ideas presented.\nIf we can record this session, that would be fantastic. Changal and I would also like to take a\npicture at the end of this session. Please stay online so we can capture everyone with their\nfaces visible.\nRemember our five principles:\n1. Always ask why.\n2. What is the change you want to see in the classroom?\n3. How do we reach all of our students at scale for all?\n4. How do we empower teachers?\n5. How do we use data more effectively?\n Final Presentation - Transcription\nToday’s discussion about teachers is critical. At the end of the day, this is a change\nmanagement process, and teachers are at the frontline of this change. I’m very excited to hear\nwhat you have to say about the role of teachers and how we can empower them to make\nchanges in the classroom.\nUnfortunately, I have some bad news. I have been called to a budget meeting by the president.\nI will be listening in but must now pass this chair over to our Vice Minister Karen to manage\nthis session. Rest assured, I will be advocating for resources to execute our action plan. With\nthat, let me pass this over to our Vice Minister. Thank you, colleagues.\nVice Minister Karen:\nThank you very much, Minister Bob, for handing over. I understand that attending a budget\nmeeting with the president is extremely important, especially as it relates to financial\ndiscussions critical to our plans for the United Republic of Learning.\nToday, we have the pleasure of listening to various countries. Let’s start immediately with\nNigeria. Mustafa, are you with us?\nNigeria - Mustafa:\nHi Karen, good afternoon. I’m doing well. Greetings from Nigeria—it is 2:11 PM here.\nVice Minister Karen:\nThank you, Mustafa. Excellent. Let’s dive straight in. The minister and I have reviewed your\nplan to leverage EdTech in teacher training for both primary and secondary education. It is\ncomprehensive, well-drafted, and includes strong points. We’d like to hear more about how\nyou plan to incentivize teachers for their professional development. What incentives will you\nprovide? Let’s start with that.\nMustafa:\nThank you, Karen, and everyone. To begin, I’d like to inform you about the Nigeria National\nTeachers Institute, which has the constitutional mandate for continuous professional\ndevelopment of teachers. With the focus now on ICT and EdTech, we believe these tools will\nnot only enhance teachers' ICT capacity but also positively impact lesson delivery and overall\nstudent outcomes.\nOne of the key ways to incentivize teachers is by formalizing certification. Many teachers worry\nthat beyond gaining knowledge, they won’t receive recognition within the system. Teachers\nvalue promotions and salary improvements as incentives. Formalizing certification could\nensure their efforts lead to recognition and career advancement, even for those with only a\nfirst degree.\nVice Minister Karen:\nAbsolutely, Mustafa. That makes sense. Do you believe the National Teachers Institute will be\nsufficient to drive these initiatives, or will additional stakeholders be involved?\nMustafa:\nEdTech is a global phenomenon and should be given the right recognition. To ensure\nsustainability, we need to review and expand our current systems. Piloting will be critical.\nThrough pilot programs, we can identify challenges related to infrastructure, policy\nenvironment, manpower, and alignment with existing curricula.\n Final Presentation - Transcription\nWe already have an institution responsible for teacher development. We simply need to\namplify the integration of EdTech into the system. By selecting communities, schools, and\nteachers for the pilot, we can assess the 360-degree impact of EdTech and refine our\napproach.\nVice Minister Karen:\nThat sounds ambitious but doable. How do you see stakeholders collaborating to integrate\nboth digital literacy and pedagogical skills into the education system?\nMustafa:\nFrom experience, stakeholder engagement is crucial. Existing bodies like quality assurance\nteams already conduct school monitoring and lesson observations. It’s about involving them in\nthe EdTech conversation and building on their institutional memory.\nFor example, organizations such as the Nigerian Computer Society, the Education Management\nInformation System (EMIS), and others involved in ICT policy can contribute valuable insights.\nAligning their expertise with our long-term vision for primary and secondary education is vital.\nWe must also establish benchmarks for students. For instance, by the end of secondary school,\nstudents should have foundational skills in web design, AI, and robotics. This ensures that even\nif students don’t proceed to university, they have practical ICT skills for the workforce.\nVice Minister Karen:\nThank you, Mustafa. Your focus on incentivization and piloting is inspiring. Let’s move on to\nKenya. Dominic and Martin, are you with us?\nKenya - Dominic and Martin:\nYes, we are here.\nVice Minister Karen:\nWonderful. How are you today?\nDominic:\nWe are doing well, thank you.\nVice Minister Karen:\nGreat. We were impressed by your progress in equipping teachers with basic digital literacy\nskills. Could you elaborate on what you mean by basic skills and how you plan to build on your\nsuccess to help teachers integrate these with pedagogical skills?\nDominic:\nBasic ICT skills refer to the ability to use digital devices, develop digital content, and leverage\nonline resources. Initially, there was a misconception that teachers needed programming or\ncoding expertise to use technology effectively. Our approach focuses on demonstrating that\ntechnology can enhance teaching across all disciplines, from languages to sciences.\nWe target multiple stakeholders, including boards of management, parents, and school\nadministrators, to emphasize the importance of technology in learning. By gaining their\nsupport, we can ensure investments in digital tools and teacher training.\n Final Presentation - Transcription\nFor teachers, we plan to use an online portal where they can access self-paced courses tailored\nto their training needs. These courses will include simplified content and support via\ncommunities of practice. We will issue certifications to those who complete the courses\nsuccessfully and provide ongoing monitoring and support.\nVice Minister Karen:\nThank you, Dominic. I appreciate your emphasis on stakeholder involvement and communities\nof practice. How do you think teachers will react to self-paced learning with limited guidance?\nDominic:\nWe anticipate initial challenges, but we have learned from our pilot program involving 300\nteachers. Based on their feedback, we simplified the content and developed offline options for\nthose with connectivity issues. We also assign trainers to support teachers via SMS and within\ntheir communities of practice.\nThis phased approach, along with peer support, should help us overcome any challenges and\nensure teachers feel confident navigating the portal.\nVice Minister Karen:\nExcellent. Thank you, Dominic and Martin. Let’s now hear from Uganda. Annette, are you with\nus?\nUganda - Annette:\nYes, I am here.\nVice Minister Karen:\nGood afternoon, Annette. How is Uganda this afternoon?\nAnnette:\nGood afternoon, Karen. Uganda is doing well.\nVice Minister Karen:\nWonderful. I understand you aim to leverage technology to enhance both pre-service and inservice teacher training. Despite existing CPD programs, adoption of digital skills in classrooms\nremains low. Why do you think this is, and how are you addressing it?\nAnnette:\nThank you, Minister. In Uganda, digital skills initiatives are often institution-based without a\nunified national framework. Schools or universities implement their own programs, leading to\ninconsistencies.\nTo address this, we’ve developed a structured approach centered on three strategies. First, we\nwill map existing digital skills and resources across institutions. Second, we will prioritize\ncapacity-building initiatives for teachers. Finally, we aim to establish a national teacher\neducation ICT curriculum to provide clear guidelines for all institutions.\nVice Minister Karen:\nThank you, Annette. I like the idea of developing a national framework and harmonizing\ninitiatives. Could you elaborate on the role of your research team and how their findings will\nbe harmonized at the national level?\n Final Presentation - Transcription\nAnnette:\nCertainly. Our research team will collect data from institutions to identify existing digital skills,\nresources, and gaps. Once the data is analyzed, we will prioritize interventions based on the\nfindings.\nFor example, we will ensure teachers can use technology to conduct research, design engaging\ncontent, and create learner-centered activities. With limited funding, we will focus on\nimpactful initiatives, such as training teachers to maximize available resources.\nOur national digital strategy will guide these efforts, ensuring every institution follows a\nstructured approach to teacher development. This will help us prepare both teachers and\nlearners for the technology-driven future.\nVice Minister Karen:\nThank you, Annette. Your structured approach and emphasis on a national strategy are\ncommendable. Let’s now move to Tanzania. Alard and Lucian, are you here?\nTanzania - Alard and Lucian:\nYes, we are here.\nVice Minister Karen:\nGreat to have you with us. I understand that your focus is on improving blended learning\nthrough CPD programs. You’ve highlighted tools, content, data, and modalities. Additionally,\nyou emphasize communities of practice. Could you explain what communities of practice mean\nin your context and how they support your objectives?\nAlard:\nGood afternoon, Karen, and everyone. Thank you for the opportunity.\nWe have developed an ACT Digital Education Strategy outlining CPD initiatives, including\nleveraging communities of practice (CoPs). CoPs provide a dynamic platform for peer-driven\nknowledge sharing, mentorship, and sustained professional growth.\nFor example, experienced teachers can mentor their peers within these communities, sharing\nbest practices, tools, and teaching methods. CoPs also foster ongoing engagement,\nencouraging teachers to stay motivated and committed to their professional development.\nAdditionally, CoPs facilitate cross-disciplinary learning, enabling teachers from different\nbackgrounds to exchange ideas and innovate. This broadens their skillsets and enhances\nblended learning approaches.\nVice Minister Karen:\nHow will you set up these communities of practice?\nAlard:\nIn Tanzania, we have established \"Hub Schools\" as centers for collaboration. Teachers from\ndifferent schools come together at these hubs to share experiences and resources.\nFor example, teachers from Hub School A can share their approaches and tools with teachers\nfrom Hub Schools B and C. We also use technology platforms like Zoom and Google Meet to\nconnect teachers virtually, enabling them to discuss challenges and solutions regularly.\n Final Presentation - Transcription\nLucian:\nTo add to Alard’s points, we also focus on co-creation within CoPs. Teachers collaborate to\ndevelop open educational resources that can be shared widely. Feedback loops within these\ncommunities ensure continuous improvement and alignment with our goals.\nBy leveraging existing technologies, we can connect teachers across regions, fostering a culture\nof collaboration and lifelong learning.\nVice Minister Karen:\nThank you, Alard and Lucian. Your strategy for CoPs is impressive and well thought out. Let’s\nmove on to Liberia. Nataniel and San, are you with us?\nLiberia - Nataniel and San:\nYes, we are here.\nVice Minister Karen:\nGood afternoon. I understand that Liberia is working to transition traditionally-minded\nteachers to a more digital approach. You’ve mentioned infrastructure deficits, teacher training,\nand resource availability as key challenges. Could you elaborate on how you are addressing\nthese challenges?\nNataniel:\nThank you, Karen. Yes, infrastructure deficits are a major challenge. Many schools lack reliable\ninternet access and modern technology. To address this, we have established digital labs in\n156 public secondary schools. These labs are equipped with computers and other tools,\nenabling students and teachers to access digital resources.\nFor teacher training, we recently trained 50 master trainers who will train 312 teachers in\nthese schools. This ensures that teachers have the confidence and skills to use digital tools\neffectively.\nResource availability remains a challenge due to limited funding. However, we are engaging\npartners like the Spec Foundation and the government to increase budget allocations for\nEdTech.\nSan:\nAnother challenge is resistance to change. Many teachers are accustomed to traditional\nmethods and view digital platforms as a threat. To address this, we’ve conducted community\nengagements to demonstrate how digital tools can complement their work rather than replace\nit.\nWe are also aligning our national curriculum with digital tools. Teachers with ICT content\nknowledge are being trained in pedagogical skills to ensure effective integration. Additionally,\nwe are leveraging a customized Learning Management System (LMS) to support teacherstudent interactions and CPD opportunities.\nVice Minister Karen:\nThank you, team Liberia. I appreciate your focus on addressing resistance and building teacher\nconfidence. It’s evident that your plans are well-aligned with your goals.\n Final Presentation - Transcription\nSarah/Alex:\nMinister Karen, Caroline from Uganda has a question for Team Tanzania.\nCaroline (Uganda):\nThank you. My question is about the practicality of communities of practice in a context where\nthere is a shortage of teachers. In Uganda, many teachers are responsible for teaching multiple\nsubjects in large classrooms. How does Tanzania address similar challenges in staffing and\ntiming for CoPs?\nAlard (Tanzania):\nThank you, Caroline, for your question. We address teacher shortages by leveraging\ntechnology to connect multiple schools. For example, one teacher can teach students across\nthree or four schools simultaneously through video conferencing tools like Zoom. This\napproach is being piloted in two regions and has shown promising results.\nFor CoPs, we use hub schools and virtual platforms to facilitate teacher collaboration. Despite\nstaffing challenges, technology enables us to create spaces for knowledge sharing and\nprofessional growth.\nVice Minister Karen:\nThank you, Tanzania. Nigeria has a follow-up question about the hierarchy and power\ndynamics within CoPs. How do you address these issues?\nAlard:\nCoPs are designed to foster peer learning, where any member can take on the role of teacher\nor learner. This dynamic reduces power imbalances and creates an environment where\neveryone contributes and benefits.\nBarbara (Expert):\nThank you, everyone. I want to emphasize the importance of scheduling these activities as part\nof teachers’ formal duties rather than extracurricular tasks. I’ve heard excellent points today,\nincluding the need for prioritization, piloting, and alignment with teaching and learning\nobjectives.\nI also want to highlight the interconnectedness of these efforts. Incentives like certification can\nmotivate teachers, but they must be linked to practical, relevant training and resources. Let’s\ncontinue focusing on people-centered strategies to ensure meaningful impact.",

For those who need assistance with English, please click\non the interpretation icon located at the bottom left of your screen.\nKaren (Vice minister): We’re going to begin, and I’ll now give the floor to our Vice Minister. Thank\nyou, Sarah, and welcome, everyone, to this final day of our Policy Academy, which began on\nMonday and will continue over the next two weeks. Today’s session marks the conclusion of our\npanel series for this week. I’m honored to be with you in my role as Deputy Minister, joined by\nour distinguished Minister Bob, who is also here with us. We sincerely thank each of you for\naccepting our invitation to participate in this fourth panel.\nThis panel continues the discussions we began on Monday and will carry forward in the coming\nweeks of the Policy Academy. The aim of today’s session is to discuss challenges and solutions\nin promoting both distance learning and the open school model, which we envision as the school\nof the future. We’re joined by representatives from various countries, including French and\nEnglish speakers, and invite all of you to feel comfortable participating in this exciting discussion.\nThroughout the week, we have encountered numerous challenges, and our minister is keen for\nus to find innovative solutions to address these issues in the months and years to come. We’ll\nbegin with a brief introduction to the “open school” concept, which we sometimes refer to as\nthe “school of the future.” This concept is emerging as a response to the global shifts in\neducation caused by the pandemic. Today’s panel is well-represented by countries impacted by\nthese shifts, including the Sahel, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Senegal, Mali, and Togo.\nThe digital transformation in education raises critical questions and offers opportunities, and\ntoday’s focus is to explore how distance learning and the concept of an open school can address\neducational challenges on a societal level. One major issue, as we’ve discussed since the\nbeginning of the week, is providing quality education to a vast number of young people while\nensuring inclusivity and equity.\nWe’ll start by hearing from our colleagues in the DRC, Togo, and Mali on the topic of distance\nlearning. I’ll begin with Thierry from the DRC. Thierry, why invest in distance learning, and what\nproblems is it designed to address?\nThank you very much, and thanks to everyone for all your contributions. I believe it's useful to\nstart by clearly distinguishing distance learning from open schools. These are complementary\nconcepts but operate independently. The need for distance education is not driven solely by\npandemics or health issues; it’s also a means of providing flexibility, especially to students at the\nvocational or university level.\nTake, for example, South Africa's UNISA, which has been offering distance education for many\nyears—even before digital technology, using books and remote support. In distance education,\nit’s crucial to define the audience and the problem being addressed. I always emphasize starting\nwith the “why” before developing solutions. We recently conducted a valuable exercise with a\nteam in Senegal and the Sahel to understand school children’s circumstances and design tailored\nsolutions.\nResearch, including studies on massive open online courses (MOOCs), shows that self-directed\nlearning is challenging. Most learners, whether young or adult, struggle to complete courses\nwithout structured support and deadlines. This highlights that distance education isn’t the same\n Friday - Transcript\nas completely independent learning. It requires a support system, sometimes even more than\ntraditional school settings, to keep learners engaged and ensure they have a channel for clearing\ndoubts and working collaboratively.\nTherefore, effective distance learning goes beyond technology—electricity, connectivity, and\nequipment must be in place, but support mechanisms are just as critical. Communication\nchannels between teachers and students help maintain engagement and address questions as\nthey arise. When designing distance learning from a pedagogical perspective, we aim to create\na supportive learning environment.\nIdeally, stable electricity, good internet access, and affordable portable equipment are available,\nbut many regions lack these resources. Thus, we must find ways to use what is available, such\nas community centers, local servers, or free Wi-Fi zones, where students can gather to\nparticipate in distance learning. For instance, Kenya’s program addresses the shortage of quality\nsecondary-level teachers, especially in rural areas, by having top teachers in urban schools\ndeliver virtual lessons to rural schools.\nThis program, launched in 2022, includes around 190 schools and features a “hub and spoke”\nmodel where expert teachers broadcast lessons in subjects like mathematics and sciences to\nnearby rural schools. However, the challenges in this project are largely human rather than\ntechnological. Logistical aspects, such as coordinating schedules and exam dates, are critical to\nthe program’s success. Thus, distance learning requires careful logistical planning alongside\ntechnological readiness.\nOn the topic of open schools, this model allows people to engage in learning experiences\nwithout a rigid structure, making education accessible to all. Open schools emphasize inclusivity\nand flexibility, providing opportunities for anyone to learn, regardless of their location or\nbackground.\nI’ll now pass the floor to Mr. Mamadou from Mali, who has his hand raised.\nDo you have anything to add? Are these the same steps you follow, or is there another approach\nyou take?\nIt's mostly the same steps. Let’s just remember that we began with defining the project\nobjectives. Starting with a clear project definition helped us set SMART objectives, which are\nessential to the project's success. Afterward, we conducted a feasibility study, as my colleague\nfrom Sael mentioned, involving all the educational departments of the Ministry of Education.\nThis study allowed us to understand the needs and aspirations of school dropouts, their current\noccupations, and the ways we might meet their needs.\nFollowing this, the next steps include data analysis, learner profiling, and stakeholder\nengagement. We will also establish consensual standards, create educational pathways, set up\nmanagement systems, mobilize resources, and focus on the training of teachers and facilitators.\nEmphasis on community mobilization is also crucial as we move towards launching the pilot\nphase, which will be closely monitored for continuous improvement. This phase, once evaluated,\nwill lead to the project's extension and ensure its long-term sustainability. Thank you.\nThat’s excellent! I see that you have well-defined steps in place. I wonder where you currently\nstand—what's the most pressing challenge you’re facing today? For instance, the Sahel project\nis a multi-country initiative that likely has unique requirements and challenges.\n Friday - Transcript\nIn the Sahel countries involved in the relaunch project, a primary challenge is the lack of\ninfrastructure, which poses significant barriers to progress. There’s also resistance to change,\nespecially from teachers and parents, which complicates implementation. Another challenge is\nthe technological gap between urban and rural areas. Urban centers generally have connectivity,\nbut it's far more difficult to ensure this in rural areas, even though the open school model is\nparticularly relevant there, where it can reach our target population effectively.\nThank you, Mr. Bassirou. As for us, our main challenge has been gathering precise data on\nspecific needs. To address this, we conducted a study with support from a consultant and World\nBank experts. However, another ongoing challenge is adhering to project deadlines set forth in\nthe roadmap. This timeline adherence remains our primary focus moving forward.\nI agree; meeting deadlines and honoring our commitments are common themes across the\nboard. Let’s return to the discussion on the difference between open schools and distance\nlearning. I would like to invite Fred, our expert, who raised some points in the chat, to elaborate\non this distinction. Fred, the floor is yours.\nThank you. To clarify, distance learning means that the learning environment does not physically\nbring students and teachers together. It can be through online courses, internet platforms, or\neven YouTube. Traditional school models, however, have structured programs that guide\ninteractions with teachers and classmates and designate times for independent study.\nIn contrast, an open school model doesn’t necessarily require a fixed structure. “Open” doesn’t\nequate to distance learning. Rather, it means learners have more flexibility. For example, if I\nneed to focus on mathematics, I can engage solely in math lessons and receive recognition for\nthat specific learning, without simultaneously committing to French or other subjects. The open\nmodel allows students to learn at their own pace, which can be essential for nomadic\ncommunities or in situations where regular attendance is interrupted.\nThe flexibility of open schools allows for engagement and disengagement as needed. Distance\nlearning and self-directed learning can be part of an open model, but they are not mandatory.\nThe open model can also include in-person instruction. The key difference is that open schools\nallow students to learn on their terms, attending classes when feasible and focusing on subjects\nthat align with their immediate needs.\nThank you for that explanation, Fred. It clarifies the distinctions well. If anyone has additional\nquestions, feel free to ask in the chat as we’ll continue these discussions in the coming weeks.\nBefore returning the floor to our Minister, I’d like to summarize the key points from our\nconversation. First, while each country faces its own challenges, common themes include\nsecuring funding, infrastructure, technical and pedagogical support, and community\ninvolvement. We also clarified the concept of open schools, which are designed to address needs\nof children who, due to various circumstances, haven't had access to formal education. By\ntargeting societal challenges such as conflict and climate change, open schools serve as a means\nto help these children reintegrate into learning.\nNext week, our discussions will focus more deeply on addressing these challenges. I’ll now pass\nthe floor back to our Minister to discuss the next steps.\nSarah: Thank you, Karen, and hello everyone. Before returning to our Minister, I’d like to give a\nbrief overview of what we’ve achieved this week and what’s in store for the next. This week, we\n Friday - Transcript\nwelcomed you to daily panels on interconnected topics, and we hope you gained insights from\nthe experiences of other countries.\nNext week, you’ll have two dedicated sessions with your instructors to work on your roadmaps,\nfocusing on how technology can address challenges in your countries. Don't forget to make at\nleast one entry in your portfolio each week to qualify for certification. We encourage you to\nwork closely with your instructors to produce meaningful outcomes by the end of this course,\nwhich you’ll present during week three.\nFred : Just a quick reminder—these sessions are meant to guide us in identifying issues and\nsetting the direction for in-depth discussions. Complex topics, like electricity infrastructure, can\ntake months to plan and resolve. These sessions help outline priorities, which we’ll explore in\nmore detail in the coming weeks. Thank you.\nTo conclude first week, the Minister has presented to everyone his word to the president.",

                    "video_transcript": "Tuesday : Devices and connectivity -Transcript\nOkay, thank you very much for being here for our second day of the Policy Academy. Yesterday,\nwe learned about the journey of four countries—Rwanda, Ethiopia, Tanzania, and Zimbabwe—\nand their progress in developing EdTech policies, now gearing up for implementation. I think it\nwas a very interesting discussion. Today, we are going to dive into one of the pillars of EdTech\npolicies. These policies have various building blocks or pillars that need to be coordinated to\ntruly maximize technology’s potential in education. Today, our focus will be on infrastructure,\nspecifically connectivity to schools, students, and teachers, as well as the devices provided to\nthem for digital learning.\nJust a reminder that the goal of this week's panel discussions is to present real-life examples of\nhow countries are tackling the challenges of designing and implementing EdTech policies. We\naim to learn as much from the successes as we do from the challenges and mistakes. I appreciate\nthe openness of our panelists for sharing both what went well and the lessons learned from the\nobstacles they encountered. We want this Policy Academy to be a safe learning space for all\nparticipating countries—a place where we can learn from each other and avoid repeating the\nsame mistakes.\nWithout further ado, I would like to invite Robert Hawkins, our Minister of the Republic of\nLearning, to start today’s conversation on devices and connectivity. Our guests today include\nrepresentatives from Tanzania, Mr. Melchiory Baltazary; Zachary Muasya from Kenya; and Kofi\nAdu-Manu from Ghana. Joining them is a group of experts, whom I am sure the Minister will call\nupon for insights on how to best implement and tackle the significant challenges in providing\ndigital infrastructure for schools.\nThank you, Lucia. Today we have the United Republic of Learning assembled to address this\nimportant challenge. It's rare to have such a meeting, and I’m gratified to see that 88 of our\ncolleagues from across the ministry are here to discuss connectivity, devices, and affordability,\nensuring access for our students. I realize there are many voices and viewpoints, so please use\nthe chat to share any questions you might have. I’ll discuss these with three colleagues who have\nbrought briefs on their current digital infrastructure strategies within our Republic. I’m also\npleased to have three advisors here today, whom I will bring into the conversation as well.\nYesterday, our colleague Peter mentioned that our President has been pressing us since last\nyear’s meeting in Tanzania on how we will accommodate the growing number of young people\nentering our education system over the next two decades. He continuously asks about our policy\nand strategy for providing quality education services across the Republic. Today, that is our\nchallenge. My colleagues at the World Bank have suggested rethinking schools as transformative\nspaces and extending education services to community centers and libraries.\nWith that in mind, I’ll start with a few questions for our guests. First, I’d like each of you to briefly\ndescribe the main connectivity challenge you face. Kofi, let’s begin with you—what would you\nsay is Ghana’s key challenge?\nThank you very much. The challenge in Ghana is reaching schools in hard-to-reach areas.\nGreat—reaching unconnected rural schools. Zachary, what about Kenya?\n Tuesday : Devices and connectivity -Transcript\nThank you, Honorable Minister. The main challenge is to ensure inclusivity throughout the\nprocess of implementing digital solutions in schools.\nThank you, Zachary. Inclusivity is essential. Melchiory, could you share Tanzania’s primary\nchallenge?\nCertainly, Minister. For Tanzania, the challenges are primarily geographic—our country is vast—\nand budgetary constraints.\nWe have identified several interrelated challenges: reaching unconnected areas, ensuring\ninclusivity, and navigating geographical and budget constraints. This raises a critical question:\nhow do we prioritize our investments? Melchiory, can you share some strategies Tanzania is\nconsidering to tackle these?\nThank you, Minister. Tanzania is currently implementing the Digital Tanzania Project to expand\nconnectivity nationwide. Additionally, we have a fund—the Universal Communications Services\nAccess Fund—aimed at ensuring schools receive connectivity. We’re also collaborating with\nmajor mobile network operators, such as Vodacom, Airtel, and Tigo, to extend connectivity.\nThank you, Melchiory. It’s encouraging to hear about the national connectivity efforts and\npartnerships. Zachary, in Kenya, how are you ensuring that digital infrastructure reaches all\nstudents, including those in remote areas?\nIn Kenya, the government is committed to improving connectivity through the Digital Literacy\nProgram. This program has partnered with telecommunications companies to extend internet\naccess to underserved areas, ensuring even remote schools receive connectivity. However, full\ncoverage has yet to be achieved due to various challenges.\nThank you, Zachary. And Kofi, how is Ghana addressing these infrastructure challenges?\nGhana’s Ministry of Education is running the School Connectivity Program, prioritizing rural and\nunderserved areas. They work with telecom providers to offer discounted services in these\nareas, and they’re also implementing offline digital resources like the iBox. This device provides\nsecondary school content and supports e-learning for schools with limited connectivity.\nThank you for sharing these insights. Victor, a senior digital development specialist from the\nWorld Bank, is with us today and has experience with connectivity projects. Victor, could you\nprovide some reflections on this discussion?\nThank you, Minister. An example from Kenya is mapping schools in relation to fiber\ninfrastructure. This helps prioritize which schools to connect first. Another challenge we\nencounter is sustaining operational costs, as governments are often better at managing capital\nexpenses but struggle with ongoing costs.\nThank you, Victor. Melchiory, how does Tanzania plan to manage the long-term operational\ncosts of digital infrastructure?\nOur approach includes incorporating connectivity costs into annual budgets, encouraging\nsustainability beyond initial capital investments. We’re also collaborating with private\ncompanies through corporate social responsibility and commercial agreements.\n Tuesday : Devices and connectivity -Transcript\nThank you, Melchiory. Zachary, as we consider devices, what has Kenya learned about procuring\ntechnology for schools?\nIn Kenya, we aim for a one-to-one device ratio, but device costs remain high. We're exploring\noptions like leasing and partnerships with tech companies to reduce expenses. We also\nrecognize the need for professional development so teachers can effectively use these devices.\nThank you, Zachary. The question of which device to prioritize remains: laptops, tablets, or\nsomething else. Kofi, in Ghana, are you starting by prioritizing devices for teachers or students?\nGhana has launched a “One Teacher, One Laptop” initiative where the government subsidizes\npart of the laptop cost, with teachers covering the remaining amount through installments. This\nhas encouraged teachers to take ownership of their devices. Additionally, we are implementing\nthe Smart Schools Project, which aims to provide tablets to senior high school students.\nThank you, Kofi. The idea of device ownership by teachers seems effective. Neil, would you offer\nsome reflections on zero-rating data costs?\nCertainly, Minister. Zero-rating data for educational websites can expand access to online\ncontent without extra spending. It requires agreements with telecom providers and\nconsolidation of digital resources to a few main URLs, promoting easier access and more\ndisciplined content selection.\nThank you, Neil. Your points on simplicity, affordability, and political commitment are vital.\nToday’s discussion has been rich, and I believe we are making progress. I want to remind\neveryone that our goal is to develop a strategic action plan by the end of this Policy Academy.\nIn summary, today’s discussion emphasized the importance of defining a clear vision for digital\neducation. Infrastructure decisions must reflect pedagogical goals. Inclusivity, prioritizing\naffordability, and recognizing the long-term costs of digital transformation were key points. Also,\ncollaborative efforts and partnerships will be essential to our success.\nThank you, Minister, and to all our participants. I look forward to seeing everyone at the same\ntime tomorrow as we continue these discussions.",

Again, our our\nobjective in these all hands ministry meetings is to share perspectives\non our.\n132 \"Robert J. Hawkins\" (4077986560)\n00:26:35.989 --> 00:27:01.669\nIdeas on important aspects of our Ed tech strategy. As I stressed\nyesterday, our good president has been pressuring me to take action, to\nnot just have a policy in place or a strategy in place, but begin to\nimplement this this policy and strategy. So today we're going to continue\nthis discussion pulling on the excellent experiences from across our\nministry to learn.\n133 \"Robert J. Hawkins\" (4077986560)\n00:27:01.669 --> 00:27:21.669\nLearn from each other and to begin to pull together this this action\nplan. We have a very tacked agenda today, so we're gonna be very brief\nwith our, with our comments, and I'll try to get as many of you involved\nas possible. But because we have such a large staff with now 83.\n134 \"Robert J. Hawkins\" (4077986560)\n00:27:21.669 --> 00:27:41.669\nColleagues in in this meeting. If you do have any questions during this\ndiscussion, please put them into the chat and we'll bring you into the\ndiscussion. If you have something urgent that you want to share, please\nraise your hand and we'll pull you into the discussion as well. So I I\nwould like to start off with this big question of.\n135 \"Robert J. Hawkins\" (4077986560)\n00:27:41.669 --> 00:28:02.119\nOf why, of, of, of the question we left yesterday, as we were discussing\ndigital infrastructure for what? What is our, what is our purpose? What\nis our objective? What do we want our students and teachers to be able to\ndo differently in the classroom and outside of the classroom as a result\nof our efforts and investments in at.\n136 \"Robert J. Hawkins\" (4077986560)\n00:28:02.119 --> 00:28:39.667\nI'd like to call on 1st our colleague Chicugomenzo from Malawi. And in\nMalawi, they have been looking at the question of what? What are digital\nskills? What is the framework? This is an essential question that we need\nto start. How are we defining digital skills? Can you please kick us off\nwith how you are thinking about the definition of digital skills?\n137 \"Chigomezgo Gondwe\" (4090032640)\n00:28:39.667 --> 00:29:00.229\nThank you very much, honorable minister. Good afternoon and greetings\nfrom Malawy. Well, when we talk about digital skills, I think it's the\ndefinition in my opinion would vary depending on the level at which we're\ntalking about digital skills. So when we're as angent, we want students\nto.\n138 \"Chigomezgo Gondwe\" (4090032640)\n Wednesday : Digital skills and resources -Transcript\n00:29:00.229 --> 00:29:20.229\nTo obtain digital skills, we want them to be able to not only know how to\nuse a computer, but we also want them at a higher education level to be\nable to have skills to produce digital products. So to develop apps, to\ndevelop software.\n139 \"Chigomezgo Gondwe\" (4090032640)\n00:29:20.229 --> 00:29:40.229\nAnd, and hardware. All those are digital skills, so there's a soft kill\nthe soft side of it as well as the hard digital skills. On the teacher on\nthe teacher front, digital skills would include, knowing not just how to\nuse.\n140 \"Chigomezgo Gondwe\" (4090032640)\n00:29:40.229 --> 00:30:00.229\nUse digital technologies, but also to be able to teach others how to use\nthose digital skills within the context of what they're used for, and how\nthese can be, for lack of better word manipulate.\n141 \"Chigomezgo Gondwe\" (4090032640)\n00:30:00.229 --> 00:30:08.778\nTo achieve the educational objectives that we're striving for as well as\nthe national goals that we're striving for.\n142 \"Robert J. Hawkins\" (4077986560)\n00:30:08.778 --> 00:30:23.880\nHow how have you, what is the framework that you have, you have used to\ndefine these digital skills? What is the process you've gone through in\nterms of developing our our framework at the United Republic of learning?\n143 \"Chigomezgo Gondwe\" (4090032640)\n00:30:23.880 --> 00:30:44.479\nAll right. Well, there are various frameworks that we work with within\nthe Ministry of education, and not only within the Ministry of Education\nbut across governments in Malawi. So we have a national digitalization\npolicy as a country.\n144 \"Chigomezgo Gondwe\" (4090032640)\n00:30:44.479 --> 00:31:04.479\nThat determines what kind of digital skills, what kind of digital\ninfrastructure and everything related to it that we need as a, as a\nnation and also particularly pertaining to education. We also have a an\nICT for development policy.\n145 \"Chigomezgo Gondwe\" (4090032640)\n00:31:04.479 --> 00:31:24.479\nAnd the national science technology and innovation policy that are\ncurrently being developed in line with that national digitalization\npolicy. Within the Ministry of education, we have what we call education\ndigitalization strategy, and it is within the context of that education\ndigitalization.\n146 \"Chigomezgo Gondwe\" (4090032640)\n00:31:24.479 --> 00:31:50.423\nStrategy that we have developed a national open distance and e learning\npolicy and a complimentary national open distance and e learning\n Wednesday : Digital skills and resources -Transcript\ntransformation strategy under which or within which edge tech policy and\nstrategy are embedded to guide digital skills acquisition in education.\n147 \"Robert J. Hawkins\" (4077986560)\n00:31:50.423 --> 00:31:55.060\nThank you, so so vulnerable minutes.\n148 \"Chigomezgo Gondwe\" (4090032640)\n00:31:55.060 --> 00:32:10.729\nIn addition to that honorable minister, you'll be interested to know also\nthat prior to rolling out of the various DG interventions that were\nrunning in Malawi, we did.\n149 \"Chigomezgo Gondwe\" (4090032640)\n00:32:10.729 --> 00:32:30.729\nTo conduct comprehensive connectivity mapping exercises. And, this\nincludes assessments that have been conducted by the World Bank through\nthe skills for.\n150 \"Chigomezgo Gondwe\" (4090032640)\n00:32:30.729 --> 00:32:47.712\nVibrant economy project. It also includes an ed tech readiness assessment\nthat was conducted by Unicef and other world Bank reports. There's a\nworld bank report that was released just last week on.\n151 \"Robert J. Hawkins\" (4077986560)\n00:32:47.712 --> 00:32:51.226\nAnd in addition to that.\n152 \"Chigomezgo Gondwe\" (4090032640)\n00:32:51.226 --> 00:33:23.869\nBut there's a Yes, but all of these are not just reports, they're actual\nstudies that we're doing. It's actual mapping that we we're doing and\nthere's mapping that has been done under the giga projects connectivity.\nAnd in fact right now as a country, we are busy conducting a technology\nneeds assessment, which is very critical for us as a nation to be able to\nidentify where the gaps are so that whatever interventions we put in\nplace must be.\n153 \"Robert J. Hawkins\" (4077986560)\n00:33:23.869 --> 00:33:43.168\nNo, absolutely. This is this is critical that that that we're, we're,\nwe're able to kind of understand what is the status of our of our school\nconnectivity that we have strategies. But I I liked what you what you\nsaid on the focus of of of this briefing on what are the skills that we\nreally want to have our students develop?\n154 \"Alcardo Alex Barakabitze\" (558975488)\n00:33:43.168 --> 00:33:53.047\nWhat do we expect some of your mistake.\n155 \"Robert J. Hawkins\" (4077986560)\n00:34:19.929 --> 00:34:39.929\nTo create new ideas, to use to facilitate both their own knowledge as\nwell as the production of new knowledge to solve the problems we have on\nthe continent. I'd like to ask Daniella from from.\n Wednesday : Digital skills and resources -Transcript\n156 \"Robert J. Hawkins\" (4077986560)\n00:34:39.929 --> 00:34:59.710\nAnd to build off of these ideas that that we've, we've we've just talked\nabout with regard to what are the skills that we want, what are the\nframeworks we should use, and how are we thinking about a curriculum for\ndigital skills? Daniella, can you share a little bit with us how you're\nthinking about developing a curriculum for digital skills?\n157 \"Daniella Athanase\" (891059456)\n00:34:59.710 --> 00:35:16.919\nHey thank you. Good evening everybody and greetings from the sessions.\nSo, in the sessions, our digital journey started around digital\ntransformation and education started around.\n158 \"Daniella Athanase\" (891059456)\n00:35:16.919 --> 00:35:36.919\nTen years or so, but picked up around 20 2021 during the the COVID time\nand prior to, to that, we were implementing digital skills or ICT\ncurriculum.\n159 \"Daniella Athanase\" (891059456)\n00:35:36.919 --> 00:35:59.779\nOnly in the secondary schools. But now since last year, we have started\nto work to develop a curriculum program digital skills curriculum program\nfor the primary schools. So we have advanced quite a bit in this pro.\n160 \"Daniella Athanase\" (891059456)\n00:35:59.779 --> 00:36:19.226\nProcess. So we are planning that as of next year school as the school\nyear begins next year around the end of January starting February. We\nwill be piloting the the programs that we have designed for the prime.\n161 \"Robert J. Hawkins\" (4077986560)\n00:36:19.765 --> 00:36:37.432\nWhat are the what are the skills that we want our grade one, two, and\nthree students to have that are different from our junior secondary\nstudents?\n162 \"Daniella Athanase\" (891059456)\n00:36:37.432 --> 00:37:03.999\nOh, ok. So we we have categorized those into four basic skills. That\nwould be communication, problem solving, media, literacy, and then the\n4th one is to help them see what they are learning related to career\ncareer wise. And for the smaller smaller.\n163 \"Robert J. Hawkins\" (4077986560)\n00:37:03.999 --> 00:37:09.581\nThis is for our, this is for our 1st grade students. We're getting them\nto think about their careers.\n164 \"Daniella Athanase\" (891059456)\n00:37:09.581 --> 00:37:16.856\nYes yes, very, very early. But we will not be out.\n165 \"Robert J. Hawkins\" (4077986560)\n00:37:16.856 --> 00:37:25.797\n Wednesday : Digital skills and resources -Transcript\n50. So I guess it's an ongoing process. We continually need to reinvent\nourselves and start thinking about our futures. That's good. I'm glad\nwe're thinking early.\n166 \"Daniella Athanase\" (891059456)\n00:37:25.797 --> 00:37:43.560\nWe we we want them to start not necessarily to make decision of what\nthey're going to do a career wise, but to, to see what they are learning,\nwhere it can lead them towards as they grow up, what they can do with the\nskills that that they are getting us from an early age.\n167 \"Robert J. Hawkins\" (4077986560)\n00:37:43.560 --> 00:38:04.099\nGood, and is this the same in secondary school? Because I imagine our\nsecondary school students really need this to be able to understand what\nmight be some, some career paths for them. And I also want to touch on\nthe issue of the huge challenge we have of dropout. And do you see that\nbeing able to communicate.\n168 \"Robert J. Hawkins\" (4077986560)\n00:38:04.099 --> 00:38:17.479\nA future, a pathway for our students with appropriate skills is keeping\nthem in school, because I'm very worried about all the number of students\nthat are dropping out, particularly from primary to secondary school.\n169 \"Daniella Athanase\" (891059456)\n00:38:17.479 --> 00:38:43.490\nYes. For secondary it's a little bit different because in secondary they\ndo have a specific subject called carry education, so this is a bit\ndifferent for them. But in regards to the curriculum that they follow in\nterms of digital skills and I see in secondary schools, it's very\nspecific depending on the level that they are in. For higher secondary,\nthey normally follow the.\n170 \"Daniella Athanase\" (891059456)\n00:38:43.490 --> 00:39:09.780\nThe IGCSC curriculum because they they sit on the IGCSC exam. However,\nfor the lower 2nd trip the secondary one up to two secondary three, as we\ncategorize them, they learn a bit more advanced in in terms of emailing.\n171 \"Daniella Athanase\" (891059456)\n00:39:09.780 --> 00:39:29.780\nAdvance, like typing or things like that that will help them to do the,\nthe, the, the various assignments that they are s that they they receive\nfrom the various classes. In regards to, to dropout yes, we do have some\nproblems with dropouts.\n172 \"Daniella Athanase\" (891059456)\n00:39:29.780 --> 00:40:02.683\nHere in session and it's mainly with the students who, who are a bit less\nable academic academic and what we we're planning to do, we we\nstrategizing maybe to make their program of study a little bit more\npractical especially in terms of where digital skills is concerned, to\nmake it a little bit more practical, more interesting so that we can\nretain them in the, in the school system.\n Wednesday : Digital skills and resources -Transcript\n173 \"Robert J. Hawkins\" (4077986560)\n00:40:02.683 --> 00:40:23.060\nThank you. I mean I, I liked I like the focus that you have on defining\nthe skills of communication both in person and online through writing\nthrough audio, through video, problem solving, identifying problems and\nbeing able to empower.\n174 \"Robert J. Hawkins\" (4077986560)\n00:40:23.060 --> 00:40:43.060\nFor young people to solve those problems ultimately. Understanding media\nand part of that is, is media literacy, understanding what's true and\nwhat's not true, how, how to engage with with media, how to create with\nmedia. And then ultimately I do think that you know while while maybe our\nour our 1st graders.\n175 \"Robert J. Hawkins\" (4077986560)\n00:40:43.060 --> 00:41:03.060\nAre still thinking about their careers and wanting to be firefighters,\nmaybe our our secondary school students, it'll be important for them to\nthink about kind of what is their purpose in the world, in their country,\nin their community, and what they can do with their skills to make a\nchange in their community. So thank you. Thank you.\n176 \"Robert J. Hawkins\" (4077986560)\n00:41:03.060 --> 00:41:23.060\nDaniella on on those and I'd like to us to continue to think about as a\nministry, what are these skills? What are the frameworks, and how do we\nteach them? Which is very difficult I don't know, how do you teach\ncreativity? How do you teach problem solving? This is a, this is a\nchallenge of for for us as a, as, as a ministry, but I think these are,\nthese are important skills.\n177 \"Robert J. Hawkins\" (4077986560)\n00:41:23.060 --> 00:41:50.240\nDiane, I I'd like to, I'd like to bring you into the conversation on this\nissue of creating then the digital content. So we've talked a bit about\nframeworks, we've talked a bit about skills, we've talked about\ncurriculum. Now how do we create the content needed to teach these\nskills? And as you remember during COVID, as a ministry, we were\nscrambling to find relevant digital content.\n178 \"Robert J. Hawkins\" (4077986560)\n00:41:50.240 --> 00:42:10.240\nThat could be delivered to our students, whether it was TV or radio or\nonline or mobile, and it was a huge challenge. So, so Diane, please,\nplease share with us some of your experiences in creating appropriate\ndigital content that we think will teach the types of skills that we want\nto see in our youth.\n179 \"Diane Sengati\" (1298264320)\n00:42:11.384 --> 00:42:28.530\nThank you very much and i'm happy to be with you and share maybe our\nexperience. As you said that we have developed some digital content to be\nused in schools. But we started with.\n180 \"Diane Sengati\" (1298264320)\n Wednesday : Digital skills and resources -Transcript\n00:42:28.530 --> 00:42:45.570\nWe started also a little bit before the COVID, but it was not clear that\nhow this would be used. So I must say that most of the lot of efforts\nwere done after the COVID.\n181 \"Diane Sengati\" (1298264320)\n00:42:45.570 --> 00:43:05.570\nSo we started with the textbooks because we had, the textbooks from the\npublishers and then we we we got we bought, we purchased the, the\ncopyright, but we were there it was not completed, so we started what we\ncall in house textbooks production.\n182 \"Diane Sengati\" (1298264320)\n00:43:05.570 --> 00:43:21.081\nThat was produced by the institution, the Minister of Education, and then\nwe had the soft copies, and then we took those textbooks and we put them\non the learning platform that we had. But, then we had.\n183 \"Robert J. Hawkins\" (4077986560)\n00:43:21.081 --> 00:43:36.714\nIs it appropriate to take a material that we use in a face to face\nenvironment and just put it into digital format for, for an online\nenvironment? What have you found in terms of material for different types\nof of of of teaching.\n184 \"Diane Sengati\" (1298264320)\n00:43:36.714 --> 00:43:57.200\nYeah, go ahead, please. At the beginning it was it At the beginning it\nwas not it was not interactive, so it was just only reading and then we\nmoved to we shifted to the more interactive features and we had also a.\n185 \"Diane Sengati\" (1298264320)\n00:43:57.200 --> 00:44:13.873\nAgain to upgrade with the upgraded the the system and integrate the\nschool database management system because we wanted to know who were our\nusers and where they were coming.\n186 \"Moussa SALL\" (1206425856)\n00:44:13.873 --> 00:44:17.431\nFrom and then because of that school database management.\n187 \"Diane Sengati\" (1298264320)\n00:44:17.431 --> 00:44:19.945\nWe integrated the.\n188 \"Moussa SALL\" (1206425856)\n00:44:19.945 --> 00:44:21.811\nStudents are the teacher's.\n189 \"Diane Sengati\" (1298264320)\n00:44:21.811 --> 00:44:42.650\nAnd then find them in their classes and also teachers would be able to\nmake their own content also for teaching and learning in their prob in\ntheir classes. But we had also some videos that we made during the COVID\nand those videos are instructional videos that were aligned directly to\nthe curriculum so the teachers.\n Wednesday : Digital skills and resources -Transcript\n190 \"Diane Sengati\" (1298264320)\n00:44:42.650 --> 00:45:09.217\nWould be able to use them and the students also to use them as reference\nor even for certain assignments. And this worked because we had one\nstudent who had to go out of Wanda but who had to continue learning\nbecause he had national exams and he used those videos and the face to\nface, forum with his teachers. And then when he came back he will he was\nable to do his national exams.\n191 \"Robert J. Hawkins\" (4077986560)\n00:45:09.217 --> 00:45:25.650\nThese are two, two interesting things Diane. One is what is content? What\nis digital content? And how do we make it engaging and interactive? I\nthink you know with during COVID what we learned was that.\n192 \"Robert J. Hawkins\" (4077986560)\n00:45:25.650 --> 00:45:45.650\nThere needs to be a form of content that that is engaging to students and\nthat empowers them with, with agency. Yes. The other lesson is that we're\nnot just talking about copying textbooks into digital format. There's the\nrole of data and.\n193 \"Robert J. Hawkins\" (4077986560)\n00:45:45.650 --> 00:46:08.930\nAnd as you said, learning kind of who is, who is learning what as well as\nthe algorithms that, you know, in, in some of these adaptive learning\nsoftwares that will provide relevant content to the students at the right\nlevel. This issue of teaching at the right level is a conundrum, is a\nchallenge for all of us, as I mentioned yesterday.\n194 \"Robert J. Hawkins\" (4077986560)\n00:46:08.930 --> 00:46:31.733\nWe have 7th grade math students who only have a 4th grade knowledge. How\ncan we bring them up to speed? And then the other point you made was the\nrole of the teacher. Our teachers content creators, can we expect them to\ncreate content, own content, and be able to deliver content that is is\npersonalized to them and their knowledge? What, what is your, what is\nyour experience.\n195 \"Diane Sengati\" (1298264320)\n00:46:31.733 --> 00:46:59.420\nYes teachers are are able to do it if you train them, of course you are\nyou need to train them, you have to start somewhere. And then we have,\ne.g., the training teacher training colleges. Those are the colleges that\ntrain teachers and for them we are starting, we have started with the\nSTEM subjects and we digitalized their exercises that they have in the\ntextbooks, but then they can also add more exercise.\n196 \"Diane Sengati\" (1298264320)\n00:46:59.420 --> 00:47:23.690\nSizes for their students and then they all they already know how to do\nthe content do to do the activities, interactive activities, but they are\nalso able to make activities that students would do and then they would\nmark them or assess them. So I think if you train teachers on how to do\nit, they are able to do it and they are actually.\n Wednesday : Digital skills and resources -Transcript\n197 \"Diane Sengati\" (1298264320)\n00:47:23.690 --> 00:47:51.074\nWe understand that they are very eager to do it. And when we talk about\naccessible, I mean interactive, we need also to think about accessibility\nto make sure that we have inclusive content where all students have to\naccess to know how to use the device the the content where e.g. we have\nadded some audio visual materials and also the sign languages.\n198 \"Robert J. Hawkins\" (4077986560)\n00:47:51.074 --> 00:48:25.210\nSo I'd like us all to think about this, you know, I get I get lots of\nlots of proposals that come across my desk. Sometimes it's a it's a new\nadaptive learning software that I'm not whether we should adapt or not.\nSometimes it's a contract for a firm that's outside of our country of the\nUnited Republic of learning to develop content and to bring content to\nour country. And I'm always struck by isn't there an opportunity to\nleverage our own capacity and resources to develop our own content.\n199 \"Robert J. Hawkins\" (4077986560)\n00:48:25.210 --> 00:48:54.527\nI I'd like to ask Yugesh because I I I know that there's lots of open\ncontent across the internet that we can use. There's lots of content\nbeing developed by our own teachers. Is there a strategy that we should\nemploy to be able to mine, assess, and integrate open digital content and\nintegrate it into our curriculum? Yugesh, can you share some perspective.\n200 \"Y PANDAY\" (1288219648)\n00:48:54.527 --> 00:49:13.590\nAnd thank you. I mean, good afternoon everybody. It's a real pleasure to\nbe here. Well, you mentioned about consuming the digital content and the\nones to consume will be the students and who best to know about the\nstudents and the teachers.\n201 \"Y PANDAY\" (1288219648)\n00:49:13.590 --> 00:49:33.590\nI believe that the narrative must start from teachers and our colleague\nGan mentioned about the importance of teachers. So how we do, how did we\ndo it in mauricious? Well, we had an expression of interest sent to\nteachers, those who are interested to come to the mauricious Institute\nof.\n202 \"Y PANDAY\" (1288219648)\n00:49:33.590 --> 00:49:57.240\nApplication to help develop the resources. So these teachers, they are in\ncontact with the students and they know the nitty gritty of the teaching\nand learning interactions. So the 1st looked at the unit lessons and you\nknow that teachers are used with planning lessons. So what they do is\nthey write the unit lesson.\n203 \"Y PANDAY\" (1288219648)\n00:49:57.240 --> 00:50:12.755\nIn a way that will scaffold the notion. There open, the work is verified\nby the subject matter experts. The subject matter experts will validate\nbefore the work goes.\n204 \"Maimouna\" (2172311808)\n Wednesday : Digital skills and resources -Transcript\n00:50:12.755 --> 00:50:15.013\nUsed to the functional.\n205 \"Y PANDAY\" (1288219648)\n00:50:15.013 --> 00:50:19.753\nDesigners. What the instructional designers do, they take the.\n206 \"Maimouna\" (2172311808)\n00:50:19.753 --> 00:50:21.259\nUnique lessons.\n207 \"Y PANDAY\" (1288219648)\n00:50:21.259 --> 00:50:54.530\nWhen they make a storyboard, they make a natural progression of what\nfollows next. What unit, what concept, what work example should be in in\na continuous line of flow before actually we can digitalize, right? So\nwhen we go on the process of digitalization, this is where the\napplication comes in. And of course the instructional designers that new\nbest what is on the market and what should be using there. Like, e.g.,\nthe.\n208 \"Y PANDAY\" (1288219648)\n00:50:54.530 --> 00:51:18.840\nInstitute in Mauricious, they have been very much active in developing a\nletter say Asian languages content. And when we got the storyboard, they\nwill be using the applications to make the rendering, to make the output\nas palatable as possible, as interesting as, you know, you know, as\ninteresting enough.\n209 \"Robert J. Hawkins\" (4077986560)\n00:51:18.840 --> 00:51:46.779\nWe have incredible resources across the United Republic of learning. To\nmake this content more engaging for young.\n210 \"Y PANDAY\" (1288219648)\n00:51:46.779 --> 00:52:07.430\nPeople. Well, I I guess it starts with a good, you know, awareness about\nthe initiative and having the instances where we can tap on the\nresources. See, I mean let me say I believe in in in all countries we do\nhave the Ministry of Arts and culture.\n211 \"Y PANDAY\" (1288219648)\n00:52:07.430 --> 00:52:23.370\nSo we can always tap on the, on the creativity that lies there. We can\nalways look for some enticing music. We can always look for some enticing\nlet's say this, rhythmic poems how to say the slams.\n212 \"Y PANDAY\" (1288219648)\n00:52:23.370 --> 00:52:40.145\nThat will come in and make learning more interesting to the students, you\nsee? So I believe that we have a whole gamut of resources around our\ninstitution. It's a matter of knowing on which doors to knock, right?\n213 \"Robert J. Hawkins\" (4077986560)\n00:52:40.145 --> 00:52:42.061\nYeah.\n Wednesday : Digital skills and resources -Transcript\n214 \"Y PANDAY\" (1288219648)\n00:52:42.061 --> 00:52:48.161\nYeah, so this is what I'm saying it's a matter of pulling the resources\nto the.\n215 \"Robert J. Hawkins\" (4077986560)\n00:52:48.161 --> 00:53:00.690\nNo, I I like I like what you have highlighted in terms of identifying the\nprocess and identifying the right people. So, how do we get our subject\nmatter experts?\n216 \"Robert J. Hawkins\" (4077986560)\n00:53:00.690 --> 00:53:19.950\nTogether with our instructional designers together with our technologists\nand also I hope that you will share with us by the end of this week some\nof your slam poetry. So we will look forward to that by the end of the\nweek.\n217 \"Robert J. Hawkins\" (4077986560)\n00:53:19.950 --> 00:53:38.850\nThank you, Yogesh. I want to come back to you and and others as well on\nthis open question of open educational resources. But before I do, I want\nto pull, we're, we're we're we're, we have an advisor with us today,\nBarbara Freeman, who has done some thinking on these issues of.\n218 \"Robert J. Hawkins\" (4077986560)\n00:53:38.850 --> 00:54:11.139\nCompetencies, skill frameworks, and what we really need from our\nteachers, not only to be creators, but ultimately to deliver education in\nin a way that mixes both the face to face as well as the digital.\nBarbara, can you share with us some some of your lessons across the\nUnited Republic of Learning on how we should think about these issues of\ndefining the skills, the frameworks, and empowering the teachers to be\nable to deliver the.\n219 \"Barbara Freeman\" (1023676928)\n00:54:11.139 --> 00:54:28.080\nSkills. Thank you Honorable minister, and I think I could do all that in\n2 min really, really briefly. I want the 1st thing I want to say is\nalways at the, at the very center of everything is really the idea of\nimproving.\n220 \"Barbara Freeman\" (1023676928)\n00:54:28.080 --> 00:54:46.761\nTeaching and learning to improve outcomes in students. And I think every\ntime we start to write anything we do, we need to pull it back to that.\nThe beauty of the digital framework is that it can help produce\nconsistently high levels of quality teaching, right? And.\n221 \"Robert J. Hawkins\" (4077986560)\n00:54:46.761 --> 00:54:51.299\nWhat is a digital frame.\n222 \"Barbara Freeman\" (1023676928)\n00:54:51.299 --> 00:55:08.080\n Wednesday : Digital skills and resources -Transcript\nAnd I put a number of resources in the chat. A digital competency\nframework focuses on the essential skills, the knowledge, but beyond that\nthe attitudes and values that both students, if you're looking at a\nstudent framework, if you're looking at a teacher framework, which we're\ntalking about now.\n223 \"Barbara Freeman\" (1023676928)\n00:55:08.080 --> 00:55:28.080\nThe teachers need, right? And within that framework, e.g., teachers need\ndifferent kinds of skills. So from a teacher perspective, we're talking\nabout digital, which are digital literacy skills. A lot of those have\nbeen enumerated by our colleagues earlier, but in addition to that\ndigital pedagological skills.\n224 \"Barbara Freeman\" (1023676928)\n00:55:28.080 --> 00:55:54.170\nAnd those are the the skills that are needed to teach effectively both in\nhybrid, remote, and in person classrooms. Digital petagogical skills are\nare broken down to into a number of different things. Many of which\nyou've talked about, the ability to include students, the ability to\npersonalize, there are a whole bunch of competencies that are sitting\nthere that.\n225 \"Barbara Freeman\" (1023676928)\n00:55:54.170 --> 00:56:17.030\nTeachers need as teachers at the core of teaching, selecting digital\nresources, being able to assess real things about teaching and learning\nand how do you empower students, but within the framework, even beyond\nthat, there's a role of teachers as learners. So how do they engage in\nprofessional communities of learning, right? How do they work with their\ncolleagues? How do they collaborate.\n226 \"Barbara Freeman\" (1023676928)\n00:56:17.030 --> 00:56:41.159\nRight, how do they continue to learn and reflect on their practices? And\nthen there's a role of teachers, also teaching digital literacy. So\nreally having those fundamental skills such as, you know, the information\nand media literacy, problem solving and and responsible use that you were\ntalking about earlier that enables them to teach these skills. So there\nare buckets of different types of skills.\n227 \"Robert J. Hawkins\" (4077986560)\n00:56:41.159 --> 00:57:06.440\nWithin these frameworks. So I'm I'm I'm I'm concerned about a few things.\nOne is, which which I've heard of digicomp, I've heard of Unesco I've\nheard of these is there should we be using an existing framework or\nshould we be creating our, our own framework? What would the.\n228 \"Barbara Freeman\" (1023676928)\n00:57:06.440 --> 00:57:22.690\nYeah, thank you for that question. I think it's a combination of the two.\nThese frameworks, the global frameworks are really well thought through,\nbut they are that. They are global frameworks. So I think it's really\nimportant to start with the.\n229 \"Barbara Freeman\" (1023676928)\n Wednesday : Digital skills and resources -Transcript\n00:57:22.690 --> 00:57:29.739\nGlobal frameworks and then localize and contextualize them to the\nparticular country's context.\n230 \"Robert J. Hawkins\" (4077986560)\n00:57:29.739 --> 00:58:06.165\nThank you. The the other the other thing that worries me is this issue of\nculture, of how do we change the mindsets of teachers to be able to take\non innovative tasks? You know, I, I hear all the time that that they have\ntoo much on their plate. They cannot take on any more and now we're\nasking them to learn digital skills, to be content creators, to teach\nonline and offline. Are we being realistic here? Are we asking too much\nof our teachers? How do we, how do we change this culture so that they\nare innovators, that they want to do, this type of work?\n231 \"Barbara Freeman\" (1023676928)\n00:58:06.165 --> 00:58:22.710\nFace is slow, right? Sometimes in order to get that started, 1st of all,\nthere you need communication, you need some kind of incentives. Those\ndon't necessarily need to be monetary incentives.\n232 \"Barbara Freeman\" (1023676928)\n00:58:22.710 --> 00:58:39.030\nBut some sort of incentives within the system. And someone said this\nearlier, it's really important to highlight the champions because there\nare champions in there that love it and and will set up a nice cascading\nsystem where you can train the trainers.\n233 \"Barbara Freeman\" (1023676928)\n00:58:39.030 --> 00:58:59.030\nI think as people gain confidence and confidence, so confidence and\nconfidence are linked to one another and as they're gaining both, right?\nIt it changes the way they see it, it changes the way that they talk\nabout it. So many of the skills that you've talked about, the\ncommunication, the collaboration, the.\n234 \"Barbara Freeman\" (1023676928)\n00:58:59.030 --> 00:59:03.606\nThings that seem soft are really important pieces of the change.\n235 \"Robert J. Hawkins\" (4077986560)\n00:59:03.606 --> 00:59:32.824\nBut it takes time. Thank you. Thank you, Barbara. Annette, I I've heard\nabout the Unite Academy as a way that we are looking at training\nteachers. Can you share and reflect a little bit on your experience with,\nwith Unites and and whether and again, what we're talking about here is\nbeing put into a practice in terms of our our teacher training, work,\nAnette.\n236 \"Moussa SALL\" (143479296)\n00:59:32.824 --> 00:59:36.609\nOkay.\n237 \"Robert J. Hawkins\" (4077986560)\n00:59:36.609 --> 00:59:41.700\nAnnata, are you with us?\n Wednesday : Digital skills and resources -Transcript\n238 \"Robert J. Hawkins\" (4077986560)\n00:59:41.700 --> 01:00:00.192\nMaybe while we're waiting for for Anette, I can ask Natalia or or\nLawrence in in Liberia to to share a little bit about how they are, oh\nhere's anette. I'm sorry Annette I see you now. Over to you and then\nwe'll go to our our colleagues in Liberia.\n239 \"Robert J. Hawkins\" (4077986560)\n01:00:07.327 --> 01:00:13.819\nYeah, I think you have some problems with, with, with audio or your\nconnectivity.\n240 \"Kajura Annet\" (62385152)\n01:00:13.819 --> 01:00:18.207\nYeah.\n241 \"Robert J. Hawkins\" (4077986560)\n01:00:18.207 --> 01:00:39.800\nCan you hear us? We cannot hear you. Okay Anette, I will come back to\nyou, but perhaps if if we cannot solve your problem, if you can share\nwith us in the chat, what you have done with the the United Academy. And\nI, I'd like to bring.\n242 \"Robert J. Hawkins\" (4077986560)\n01:00:39.800 --> 01:01:02.110\nNatalia into this conversation, to reflect a little bit on on how the\nteam in Liberia is is thinking about digital content, curriculum,\nproduction of materials, and the role of teachers. Natalia.\n243 \"Kajura Annet\" (62385152)\n01:01:02.110 --> 01:01:07.806\nHello? Yes. When I miss.\n244 \"Robert J. Hawkins\" (4077986560)\n01:01:07.806 --> 01:01:15.780\nSo do you hear me now? I let you back. Welcome back. We were worried\nabout you. We were about to go send direct to find you, but you're you're\nback.\n245 \"Kajura Annet\" (62385152)\n01:01:15.766 --> 01:01:18.327\nI am just maybe I I don'.\n246 \"Robert J. Hawkins\" (4077986560)\n01:01:18.327 --> 01:01:23.906\nWithout video, I think without video, we saw your beautiful face. So now\nwe can hear your beautiful voice.\n247 \"Kajura Annet\" (62385152)\n01:01:23.906 --> 01:01:51.335\nThank you very much. Unita stands for Uganda National Institute for\nteacher education. And it is one of the new institutions that we are\ntrying to to start, and it is it is meant to help us to have a number of\nreforms that would help us to improve teacher quality in the country.\n248 \"Kajura Annet\" (62385152)\n Wednesday : Digital skills and resources -Transcript\n01:01:51.335 --> 01:02:11.886\nAs we have heard from colleagues, Uganda is among other developing\ncountries that are trying to stand strong on the use of digital skills,\nwhich has not been a strong aspect that has been.\n249 \"Kajura Annet\" (62385152)\n01:02:11.886 --> 01:02:32.225\nIs focused on in teacher training institutions, but the programs that has\nbeen developed to be focused on by Unity have put a lot of emphasis that\nwill support the teacher training so that the teacher comes out when he's\nhe he or she is able to.\n250 \"Kajura Annet\" (62385152)\n01:02:49.784 --> 01:03:14.327\nToday you gonna teach us skills digital skills are I want to say they are\nat besk and a smaller percentage about can I say 6 % are intermediate\nwhile we have like zero point something that are advanced because I can't\nsay we don't have a.\n251 \"Kajura Annet\" (62385152)\n01:03:14.841 --> 01:03:17.189\nBut after you knew.\n252 \"Robert J. Hawkins\" (4077986560)\n01:03:17.189 --> 01:03:31.325\nAre you thinking of teachers who can use software to create content or\nteachers who are able to manage an online course? What, what, what is\nyour definition of advanced.\n253 \"Kajura Annet\" (62385152)\n01:03:31.325 --> 01:03:52.190\nAdvanced care I'm talking about the teachers who can design an online\ncourse, they can develop a software, they can do some security cyber\nsecurity for the technology in the institutions, but it is the smallest\npercentage that we have, but we have them.\n254 \"Kajura Annet\" (62385152)\n01:03:52.190 --> 01:04:10.396\nAnd we hope that after the graduates from Unity have come out, we should\nbe able to have at least a good number, about 50 % at at the level of\nintermediate.\n255 \"Kajura Annet\" (62385152)\n01:04:10.396 --> 01:04:30.396\nThis intermediate teacher level skill we would think that he should be\nable to navigate his teaching and learning to develop lessons to assess\nthe learners using technology. It the, the, the new program that have\nbeen developed by Unity which are going to be.\n256 \"Kajura Annet\" (62385152)\n01:04:30.396 --> 01:04:50.396\nImplemented starting next year. They have made sure that every\ncombination, there is a program that is focusing on the use of technology\nin teaching and learning, development of materials and being able to use\nother.\n Wednesday : Digital skills and resources -Transcript\n257 \"Kajura Annet\" (62385152)\n01:04:50.396 --> 01:05:06.316\nMaterials from other countries but be able to customize them in such a\nway that the learner from the, our country does not get what he will not\nunderstand.\n258 \"Kajura Annet\" (62385152)\n01:05:06.316 --> 01:05:23.206\nBut be able to relate the environment, be able to solve the problems\nusing the technology that the teacher will be using. So that's one of the\nareas that we think when the unit is up and running.\n259 \"Kajura Annet\" (62385152)\n01:05:23.206 --> 01:05:38.806\nWill be producing a teacher that will be able to access, to support the\nlearner to communicate, support the learner to be able to collaborate, to\nsupport the learner to be able to manage media.\n260 \"Kajura Annet\" (62385152)\n01:05:38.806 --> 01:05:58.806\nMaybe can be able to publish, maybe can be able to, answer different\nquestions in the media without offending himself or the country. At the\nsame time, we have just launched the digital strategy as a country.\n261 \"Kajura Annet\" (62385152)\n01:05:58.806 --> 01:06:18.806\nWhich we think is going to support every business that is going to be in\nline with technology in the country. We have now embarked in on making\nsure that we populate the content that we will be focusing at different\nlevels of learning.\n262 \"Kajura Annet\" (62385152)\n01:06:18.806 --> 01:06:39.555\nThink and different categories of teachers from pre primary to learning\nother higher learning institutions. As you know, developed countries\nalready have their learners starting technology from pre primary. But\nwhen I look at our status now, we find that.\n263 \"Kajura Annet\" (62385152)\n01:06:39.555 --> 01:06:57.075\nWe are behind because teachers are behind. When teachers are empowered,\nif we build capacity of the learners, we think at every level that is\nsupposed to be in digital framework will be catered for. The digital\nframework that we have right now.\n264 \"Kajura Annet\" (62385152)\n01:06:57.075 --> 01:07:14.445\nIs the global as the Barbara has just said because it was developed by\nUnesco and modified by Unicef. However, it lacks guideline that would\nspecifically focus on the teacher.\n265 \"Kajura Annet\" (62385152)\n01:07:14.445 --> 01:07:34.445\nAs it is now, Unicef modified it and is citizen framework. Even the pilot\nfocused on the learners rather on the use between 15 to 24.\n Wednesday : Digital skills and resources -Transcript\n266 \"Kajura Annet\" (62385152)\n01:07:34.445 --> 01:07:59.383\nAnd in school and out of school. But when you look at the dictative\nframework, you need someone that will guide the learners, and in this\nspace, we need to empower the teacher to be able to use technology to\nmanage data. As you all know, data is the backbone of everything because\nevery planning that we do is.\n267 \"Robert J. Hawkins\" (4077986560)\n01:07:59.383 --> 01:08:20.595\nI want to dig a little bit deeper on. You you're talking about the\nimportance of data. So again, this gets back to our challenge of teaching\nat the right level of helping teachers to understand where each learner\nis in their journey. And you mentioned.\n268 \"Robert J. Hawkins\" (4077986560)\n01:08:20.595 --> 01:08:40.595\nPersonalized and this is this is ultimately what we would love to be able\nto do instead of having our teachers in front of 607080a hundred students\nteaching to the mass, how can they personalize teaching to every student?\nIs that even even realistic? Customizing then.\n269 \"Robert J. Hawkins\" (4077986560)\n01:08:40.595 --> 01:09:00.595\nThe content and the type of activities that we give to to students. And\nthis issue around language also, how do we, how do we think about\ncreating a content in in different languages or should we focus on the\nprimary engli languages of of English and French and Portuguese? How how\ndo we think about.\n270 \"Robert J. Hawkins\" (4077986560)\n01:09:00.595 --> 01:09:20.595\nAbout that aspect to be able to teach our students where where they are.\nAnd, and I liked what you said also about empowering teachers as well as\ntheir role in reaching both in school and out of school youth as\nfacilitators. If you can give me.\n271 \"Robert J. Hawkins\" (4077986560)\n01:09:20.595 --> 01:09:40.595\nOne, and I and then I want to move on. We have another expert with us,\nLaura Gregory who I'll ask to come in next, but if you can give me one\ndefinition of how you see teachers use the word facilitator to guide the\nlearner. Is this changing their role from disseminating knowledge?\n272 \"Robert J. Hawkins\" (4077986560)\n01:09:40.595 --> 01:09:58.342\nTo playing this active role of of engaging with students on a more one to\none basis, what what do you mean by facilitator? Annette, do you still\nwith us?\n273 \"Kajura Annet\" (62385152)\n01:09:58.342 --> 01:10:06.482\nYes, I'm still with you. I I don't think I've got any.\n274 \"Robert J. Hawkins\" (4077986560)\n Wednesday : Digital skills and resources -Transcript\n01:10:06.482 --> 01:10:35.205\nAh, NO, I, I was asking you teacher to be a facilitator to guide the the\nlearning process. And I'm wondering whether this is a fundamental change\nin the role that we're asking teachers to take on in the classroom for\nbeing a disseminator of knowledge and delivering the curriculum so that\nstudents can, in many cases, most cases memorize it.\n275 \"Robert J. Hawkins\" (4077986560)\n01:10:35.205 --> 01:10:55.205\nAnd, represented on a test to being more of a facilitator to guide\nindividual learning journey. Is it, is that even in concept it's it's\nvery attractive, but is this, is this realistic? And let me just leave\nmaybe that question open for for everybody and let me ask one of our\nworld Bank colleagues thank.\n276 \"Robert J. Hawkins\" (4077986560)\n01:10:55.205 --> 01:11:11.685\nThank you Laura, for joining us today, and I'd like to get your\nperspective on this conversation and and how we as the United Republic of\nLearning should think about teachers, the changing role of teachers and\nteacher capacities.\n277 \"Robert J. Hawkins\" (4077986560)\n01:11:11.685 --> 01:11:31.215\nBecause the reality is that many teachers in the United Republic of\nLearning are teaching 7th grade math, but barely have a 6th or 7th grade\nmath content knowledge. The the data that I'm being showed on the\ncapacity and knowledge of our teachers.\n278 \"Robert J. Hawkins\" (4077986560)\n01:11:31.215 --> 01:11:47.055\nIs frightening in terms of their own levels of knowledge and capacity,\nlet alone pedagogical skills. We're, we're asking them to then take on\nclasses that are, 40 5060 students.\n279 \"Robert J. Hawkins\" (4077986560)\n01:11:47.055 --> 01:12:02.415\nWith limited resources. Are we asking too much of, of, of teachers and\nand how should we think about, the other challenge we have in our in our\nin our in the United Republic of learning of learning poverty, of the\nfact that most of our students.\n280 \"Robert J. Hawkins\" (4077986560)\n01:12:02.415 --> 01:12:29.804\nCannot at ten years of age, cannot read a simple paragraph? Are we kind\nof moving too far ahead with our thinking about what teachers could be\nwhen teachers don't have the content knowledge and we have students that\nare not learning in our schools right now? Laura, maybe you can give us\nsome, some perspectives on how we should think about our our teachers in\nthis era, that we're entering with increasing use of digitalization.\n281 \"Laura Gregory\" (2390863616)\n01:12:29.804 --> 01:12:50.615\n Wednesday : Digital skills and resources -Transcript\nLaura. Thank you, your excellency and I see that here in the United\nRepublic of Learning, you're leading this all hands ministry meeting in a\nway where you are asking a lot of questions and I want to turn that\naround to you in a way and say, what is a teacher? What are we expecting\na teacher to be? And right now, a teacher.\n282 \"Laura Gregory\" (2390863616)\n01:12:50.615 --> 01:13:24.425\nRightly or wrongly believes that they are the ones with the knowledge,\nthey are the ones with the expertise who can guide the student. That's\nwhere they're from. And I think listening to all these excellent\ninitiatives that are happening, I I wanted to give a thought of teaching\nat the right level, of course, is really important for the student, but\nalso teaching at the right level for the teacher is also really\nimportant. If we think about where a teacher comes in, their initial\neducation or their pre service education, that's where they learn.\n283 \"Laura Gregory\" (2390863616)\n01:13:24.425 --> 01:13:52.865\nAnd they build a base of knowledge and understanding of what it means to\nbe a teacher, what it means to teach the subject that they're teaching.\nAnd then as they continue through, in their continuous professional\ndevelopment, that builds on that base knowledge of what it means to be a\nteacher, and we're shaking things up completely here and saying, actually\nwhat it means to be a teacher is something a bit different than what you\nthought it was. So that's a huge shift, and that's really daunting.\n284 \"Laura Gregory\" (2390863616)\n01:13:52.865 --> 01:14:16.841\nFor teachers. Add on top of that, that these young people are always\ngoing to be a step ahead on technology, even if they're not a step ahead\non technology, they are learning this at the same time that you're\nlearning it as a teacher, and that's also really, really daunting. And\nthen there's another thing I wanted to raise in terms of, well, several,\nso you cut me off when you're ready.\n285 \"Robert J. Hawkins\" (4077986560)\n01:14:16.841 --> 01:14:20.224\nI'm very good at cutting people off Laura.\n286 \"Laura Gregory\" (2390863616)\n01:14:20.224 --> 01:14:37.665\nWe actually, yeah, I don't need to remind you of that one. We need to\nthink about teaching at the right level for the teachers in their\ntraining, but they all have different needs, but we can't man, we're not\ngonna get there if we think about going in and training each teacher\nseparately.\n287 \"Laura Gregory\" (2390863616)\n01:14:37.665 --> 01:14:56.955\nThat's we're never gonna get there. They've got classes of over a hundred\nactually we've seen in the data well over a hundred. But we also have a\nlot of teachers. So we need to think about groups of teachers and what\nare the different needs for these groups of teachers? I really loved\nhearing what somebody say about the.\n Wednesday : Digital skills and resources -Transcript\n288 \"Laura Gregory\" (2390863616)\n01:14:56.955 --> 01:15:16.955\nThis, I jotted it down as the stars that we have in the system for\ntechnology, maybe it was champions. The ones who were excited about it,\nand there was the example of how they were, there was a offer for, them\nto come in and help support.\n289 \"Laura Gregory\" (2390863616)\n01:15:16.955 --> 01:15:49.919\nMalicious some of the development materials and that's fantastic. Give\nthose people who really, it's almost like a specialist teacher role. Now\nyou have specialist literacy teachers. Not every teacher can know\neverything about the best way to teach reading, but if schools have or\nhave in the schools or access to literacy specialists that helps them.\nSame with the digital, there are some people gonna excel. Not everybody\nwill excel because they're excelling at other things, but they need\naccess to the people. So seeing the school as that community of a lot of\ndifferent expertise is another thing.\n290 \"Robert J. Hawkins\" (4077986560)\n01:15:49.919 --> 01:16:16.748\nWhat are the skills or competencies of teachers and be able to bring them\ntogether in communities and groups. And really what we're talking about\nis fostering teacher teams or communities or groups so that they're not\nworking in isolation from each other.\n291 \"Laura Gregory\" (2390863616)\n01:16:16.748 --> 01:16:23.926\nExactly exactly. And if you think about good quality professional\ndevelopment, it is all about.\n292 \"Robert J. Hawkins\" (4077986560)\n01:16:23.926 --> 01:16:40.185\nThe collaboration. Is there ways to do this more effectively than in the\npast and even connecting teachers across schools, even across countries?\nWhat what how should we think about this type of.\n293 \"Laura Gregory\" (2390863616)\n01:16:40.185 --> 01:17:00.585\nYeah exactly. I mean, if you think what you mentioned before teachers\nhave too much to do. We have to make this introduction of new digital\nskills or use of technology to be something that makes it easier for them\nand the people who understand that are their fellow teachers. So we saw\nin COVID.\n294 \"Laura Gregory\" (2390863616)\n01:17:00.585 --> 01:17:20.585\nAll of these WhatsApp groups connections, some of the countries that did\nbest facilitated an easy way for teachers to share ideas through those\nprofessional communities. A professional community of learning could be\nhuge, massive or it could be very small in the school. So yes, of course\ntechnology, you mentioned the consuming the connect.\n295 \"Laura Gregory\" (2390863616)\n Wednesday : Digital skills and resources -Transcript\n01:17:20.585 --> 01:17:49.505\nActivity that's connecting people. It has a big role to play there. I\nwanted to shout out a couple of other quick things. We need to realize\nwith teachers that they're doing a job. They're a professional already.\nWe can't just change everything. It has to change has to be something\nfamiliar to them. So keep it familiar, but they're also, it's great to\ntalk about the quality, their input to the teaching and learning\nmaterials. It's crucial they have input to the teaching and learning\nmaterials, but they.\n296 \"Laura Gregory\" (2390863616)\n01:17:49.505 --> 01:18:11.008\nYou need high quality teaching learning materials and they don't have the\nskills and they're not expected to have the skills to make really high\nquality teaching and learning materials. That's where you need to pull in\nother, as you mentioned creative people out in the, in community, in\nother professions that can create those really good materials Cause if\nyou give a teacher really good teaching and learning materials, they'll\nrun with it. Sorry, I asked you questioned and.\n297 \"Robert J. Hawkins\" (4077986560)\n01:18:11.008 --> 01:18:28.745\nThat I digressed. No thank you Laura, and and I liked your question\nbecause this is a fundamental question that we need to be asking across\nthe United Republic of learning. What is a teacher? And I'll throw out\nsome ideas from my own perspective as as minister, but I would like\nothers to draw.\n298 \"Robert J. Hawkins\" (4077986560)\n01:18:28.745 --> 01:18:53.045\nUp in maybe their ideas into the chat and maybe as a collective we can\nhelp define the teacher. But I think you've touched upon it Laura, in\nsome of your comments. One, I would like our teachers not to just be\nteachers and have the pressure of having to know and disseminate\nknowledge. I want them to be learners. I want all of our classrooms to be\ncommunities of learners so that teachers are learning from each other.\nTeachers are learning from students, and students are learning.\n299 \"Robert J. Hawkins\" (4077986560)\n01:18:53.045 --> 01:19:10.185\nThe 2nd ideal for me is that teachers are innovators, that they are\nchangemakers, that they have a sense of their role in the community that\ntranscends their classroom.\n300 \"Robert J. Hawkins\" (4077986560)\n01:19:10.185 --> 01:19:30.185\nThat they are working to empower their students to make a change in their\ncommunity. So I want them to see themselves as key members of their\ncommunity. And the final point is I, I want to feel love. I mean, maybe,\nmaybe that's a that's a trit statement, but I, when I walk into a\nclassroom, I want to feel.\n301 \"Robert J. Hawkins\" (4077986560)\n01:19:30.185 --> 01:19:50.185\n Wednesday : Digital skills and resources -Transcript\nSo for me, these are what I want from our teachers. Let me I want to\nbring in, we have we're we're very lucky to have a few colleagues from\nthe private sector.\n302 \"Robert J. Hawkins\" (4077986560)\n01:19:50.185 --> 01:20:06.015\nWe have a colleague from Google who has joined this meeting, I've invited\nhim to this meeting as well as from from Microsoft. But before I get to\nthese questions around new technologies, we haven't had a chance to hear\nfrom Natalia or Lawrence.\n303 \"Robert J. Hawkins\" (4077986560)\n01:20:26.015 --> 01:20:40.665\nAnd if you're speaking.\n304 \"Robert J. Hawkins\" (4077986560)\n01:20:46.042 --> 01:20:48.406\nWe're.\n305 \"Mamadou KANTE\" (486480384)\n01:20:48.406 --> 01:20:52.125\nAlright, so.\n306 \"Nathaniel Cisco\" (3944754432)\n01:20:52.125 --> 01:20:53.235\nOkay.\n307 \"Nathaniel Cisco\" (3944754432)\n01:20:53.235 --> 01:21:13.235\nIt's a healthy conversation and I want to say to the minister and the\nrest of the team, we are doing a fantastic job and we are learning from\nLikeburyo, as I always said, Liberia is a is a new is a is a new day like\nwe're merging and bringing new technology to help learning games. So,\nwe've.\n308 \"Nathaniel Cisco\" (3944754432)\n01:21:13.235 --> 01:21:33.235\nRespect to to digital content because one of the things we talked to talk\nabout from our team perspective is is the issue of digital content and\nthat is a modernizing paper based approach of the paper based approach of\nthe curriculum to with a more digital, you know, a platform where our\nstudents are.\n309 \"Nathaniel Cisco\" (3944754432)\n01:21:33.235 --> 01:21:53.235\nAble to access those contents and also teachers are able to access them\nand make them relevant so that we all can gain some kind of learning\ninput. So presently we are using the manual curriculum. We have to depend\non folks from one.\n310 \"Nathaniel Cisco\" (3944754432)\n01:21:53.235 --> 01:22:11.055\nOf the country to another books that have restraps subjects, restraps\nsubject contents moving around the country and sometimes to have those\n Wednesday : Digital skills and resources -Transcript\nbooks to other schools especially in rough rural areas, and it's not just\npossible, and and and and and we think that.\n311 \"Nathaniel Cisco\" (3944754432)\n01:22:11.055 --> 01:22:31.055\nIt's because of the approach we are using. And since Airtech now is\nproviding the solution, we, we, we want to move on. We want to transition\nto, to, to a more reliable, a more, a more efficient platform where our\nour lesson content can, can rest upon.\n312 \"Nathaniel Cisco\" (3944754432)\n01:22:31.055 --> 01:22:51.055\nOur air tech platform and then teachers are able to have that accessible\nwhether a near Morovia, the capital city or five from the capital city.\nAnd we know there are many disadvantages we have with respect to\ntechnology, the digital divide in Liberia is why they are pulled.\n313 \"Nathaniel Cisco\" (3944754432)\n01:22:51.055 --> 01:23:17.495\nTechnology not many institutions do have good connectivity and they are\nschools almost at 87 % of our schools that are without internet\nelectricity. It is most recently a world Bank has supported the IRAS\nproject that is the secondary schools, so 156 of our secondary schools\nnow do have some set of electricity and we are deploying these computers\nin.\n314 \"Nathaniel Cisco\" (3944754432)\n01:23:17.495 --> 01:23:37.495\nEquipments, the C three macro cloud system where we are able to to to to\nput our lessons on it, the lessons, the, the curriculum for those set of\nhundred and 56 schools are placed on the students are able to, to, to use\ntheir laptop from any part of the campus to access, you know, aid. I'm\ntalking about digital cont.\n315 \"Nathaniel Cisco\" (3944754432)\n01:23:37.495 --> 01:23:57.495\nAnd before the COVID 19, we also developed some sort of digital content\nbecause the kids, the students will still at home. We developed those\ncontents using the radio and and and thanks and thanks to the Unicef who\nsupported that initiative presently what I said beneath this building,\nbelieve.\n316 \"Nathaniel Cisco\" (3944754432)\n01:23:57.495 --> 01:24:09.961\nThe education ministry building, which do have a a a room, a radio room\nwhere place on radio and then the simulate.\n317 \"Robert J. Hawkins\" (4077986560)\n01:24:09.961 --> 01:24:27.425\nAnd the.\n318 \"Robert J. Hawkins\" (4077986560)\n01:24:27.425 --> 01:24:58.535\nReality that we have to look at offline content and and our our\ncolleagues from Ghana shared some of the solutions that they have for\n Wednesday : Digital skills and resources -Transcript\noffline content. But how should we think about developing digital\ncontent? What are our lessons from COVID such that we could develop\ncontent in modules that could be used on our learning management systems,\nbut could also be used as part of our radio programming, could be used as\npart of our distance TV programming, so that we are leveraging.\n319 \"Robert J. Hawkins\" (4077986560)\n01:24:58.535 --> 01:25:19.150\nThe content that we're producing to be able to distribute it across\nmultiple channels, even across mobile devices. How should we be thinking\nabout again development of digital content in a format that is able to be\ndistributed across many many different channels to reach many different\ntypes of learners. Natalia I don't know if you have any.\n320 \"Nathaniel Cisco\" (3944754432)\n01:25:19.150 --> 01:25:47.755\nYes, those contents can be easily developed using expects. We we do have\nexperts that come from various backgrounds and and for Liberia now the\nradio, the radio is accessible in most part of the country that is\neasier, you have radio reaching as far as to the back. So we we break\nexperts from, from various.\n321 \"Nathaniel Cisco\" (3944754432)\n01:25:47.755 --> 01:26:12.875\nGoes and we bring them based on subject areas the the the set and then\nthe the the developed contents are being are small contents and not, not\nthat difficult, very smaller content especially for primary levels, and\nthen those contents are placed on CDs and sometimes on memory stake and\nthey are taken to the the the local radio station within those\ncommunities. But we think we.\n322 \"Nathaniel Cisco\" (3944754432)\n01:26:12.875 --> 01:26:32.875\nThen we we can pass that you you bring the kid, the the students from\nfrom from the areas and you bring them in the city and and then there's\nabsolutely NO idea about about a computer. So we we we want to move to\nusing that trajectory. We we don't want to re.\n323 \"Nathaniel Cisco\" (3944754432)\n01:26:32.875 --> 01:26:52.875\nMe at at the radio because not many of the students are even able to sit\nfor long hours listening to radio. So we we we want to make the module\nmore interactive where they are able to see graphics, they are able to\nsee pictures, they're able to see those animated contents to help them,\nalright to see it. So we, we think.\n324 \"Nathaniel Cisco\" (3944754432)\n01:26:52.875 --> 01:27:12.875\nThat newsing animations, newsing of AI technology or those kind of those\nkind of tech, those kind of platform can easily because they are\nattractive many of our students are excited about robotic. All right? So\nwe we think we want to move move with with that perspective. If we are\nwith if we had afforded new new a new.\n325 \"Nathaniel Cisco\" (3944754432)\n01:27:12.875 --> 01:27:32.875\n Wednesday : Digital skills and resources -Transcript\nMethod and and and afforded this air tech thing that we started, we think\nwe can move, we can move forward. I I also heard the the friend who who\ntalk about, you know, the offline content and and that's something we we\nare working on currently placing smaller servers in communities where the\nstudents around that are able to lock on.\n326 \"Nathaniel Cisco\" (3944754432)\n01:27:32.875 --> 01:27:42.759\nAnd and those contents, they are able to access those kind of contents\nand and that's the approach except end of my my my teammate in the room\nwant to say something concerning that.\n327 \"Robert J. Hawkins\" (4077986560)\n01:27:42.759 --> 01:27:52.142\nThank you Nathaniel. Do you do you have a I'm sorry you said your\nteammates, is that, is that Lawrence?\n328 \"Gbe Lawrence Taylor\" (68044032)\n01:27:52.683 --> 01:27:57.483\nLawrence says that it's there. So.\n329 \"Robert J. Hawkins\" (4077986560)\n01:27:57.483 --> 01:28:17.860\nYeah let me Lawrence, before I go to you into this conversation. I.\n330 \"Mamadou KANTE\" (486480384)\n01:28:17.860 --> 01:28:37.095\nPremier participant.\n331 \"Robert J.

Hawkins\" (4077986560)\n01:30:28.715 --> 01:30:38.847\n Wednesday : Digital skills and resources -Transcript\nOkay, very good. I I want to go back to something that Natalia said\naround the importance.\n338 \"Mamadou KANTE\" (486480384)\n01:30:38.847 --> 01:30:41.570\nThat is.\n339 \"Robert J. Hawkins\" (4077986560)\n01:30:41.570 --> 01:31:11.565\nThank you Momadu. Accelerating learning and the urgency that we face. As\nas I started yesterday, our our president, after he came back from the\nhead of state meeting in in in Dara Salam had highlighted the challenges\nwe face as a country and as a ministry with our opportunity of the dem\ndemographic dividend, the number of young people coming into our system,\nas well as the challenges.\n340 \"Robert J. Hawkins\" (4077986560)\n01:31:11.565 --> 01:31:31.565\nIt Poses to our education system with regard to building enough schools,\ntraining enough teachers, and the reality that we have in many parts of\nof the United Republic of learning up to 80 % learning poverty, where we\nhave a young person of ten years old who cannot read a a simple\nparagraph.\n341 \"Robert J. Hawkins\" (4077986560)\n01:31:31.565 --> 01:31:59.657\nNow, a year ago when we had our last policy academy, somebody came to me\nand I said mr. Minister, we must accelerate AI, and I said, what is AI?\nYes, African intelligence. We must accelerate African intelligence. He\nsaid NO NO NO NO. I'm talking artificial intelligence. And I said, No, NO\nNO. We need real intelligence. So we had a long debate around what is\nartificial intelligence and how can it help us? So I, I'm I'm.\n342 \"Robert J. Hawkins\" (4077986560)\n01:32:02.522 --> 01:32:24.665\nFrom a Google DeepMind, who have many conversations with on how new\ntechnologies to help us address some of these intractable problems. But\nObam, what what is artificial intelligence and how can it help many of\nthe problems we've been discussing today? I wonder if you can share with\nthe ministry your perspective, Obam.\n343 \"Obum Ekeke\" (99848192)\n01:32:24.665 --> 01:32:45.465\nThank thank you so much Bob for having me and thank you everyone. It's\nreally great to to be here. I lead education work at google DeepMind.\nGoogle Deep Mind is the AI unit of of google. As, as Natalia, I think he\nwas Natanielle.\n344 \"Obum Ekeke\" (99848192)\n01:32:45.465 --> 01:33:01.845\nAs Natalia rightly said, AI is fundamentally changing how we are\napproaching learning and education, and he's already started to enable\npowerful new ways to support educators, educators and learning.\n345 \"Obum Ekeke\" (99848192)\n Wednesday : Digital skills and resources -Transcript\n01:33:01.845 --> 01:33:21.845\nIt's really exciting to hear to listen to all the conversations we've\nbeen having and and how in there are so many ways that AI could play a\nrole in in tackling some of those problems, but again permit me to say\nthat technology itself, even with AI.\n346 \"Obum Ekeke\" (99848192)\n01:33:21.845 --> 01:33:42.515\nAI can never replace the magic of a teacher. Teachers bring magic in the\nclassroom. And they've deployed very deliberately and thoughtfully, AI\ncould really help to augment the capacity of the of the of a teacher. And\nover time then AI.\n347 \"Obum Ekeke\" (99848192)\n01:33:42.515 --> 01:34:15.015\nI could help teachers to have more time to invest in themselves and also\nin their students. There are a few areas I'm particularly excited.\nThey're also very relevant to the discussions we've been having today.\nOne area is a work we've been doing on this thing called learn large,\nlearn large models or learn language models, which is learn LM for short.\nI'll drop the link on the on the chat. And learn LM is a family of new\nmodel of AI models.\n348 \"Obum Ekeke\" (99848192)\n01:34:15.015 --> 01:34:35.015\nThat is fine tuned specifically for learning, right? And grounded in\neducational research to make teaching and learning experiences more\nengaging, more active, and most more personalized. There are two areas in\nlearn LM that exists me and are most relevant to the discussions we've\nbeen having.\n349 \"Obum Ekeke\" (99848192)\n01:34:35.015 --> 01:34:55.015\nOne, I think there's been a lot of discussion around content creation,\nhow can we support teachers? Teachers spend a lot of their time on lesson\nplanning and creating, looking for content to use in the classroom. And\npart of learn LM is to actually be able part of the goal for learn LM is\nto be able to.\n350 \"Obum Ekeke\" (99848192)\n01:34:55.015 --> 01:35:15.335\nAnd as read that whole process, help teachers to be able to generate\ncontents using AI and they can use that those contents for lesson\nplanning and do all sorts of things. So they can then free up their time\nto engage deeper with their students. They know more, they know about\ntheir students much more than.\n351 \"Obum Ekeke\" (99848192)\n01:35:15.335 --> 01:35:36.845\nAI would ever know, right? So that's one area that AI is playing a very\ncritical role around content creation, around lesson planning, and many\nother administrative tasks that usually take teachers hours if not days\nor weeks to complete. The other area that excites me a lot is around\npersonalized learning.\n Wednesday : Digital skills and resources -Transcript\n352 \"Obum Ekeke\" (99848192)\n01:35:36.845 --> 01:36:08.705\nWhich is one of the things we also, the discussions I've been hearing.\nPersonalized learning here is the way education is designed today,\nassumes a one size fits all for every learners regardless of their, the\nlearners learning ability or style of learning. AI is actually beginning\nto play a very critical role especially around one to one tutorient. We\nhave this vision to have an AI tool that would help every learner to have\nthat one to one experience in learning and.\n353 \"Obum Ekeke\" (99848192)\n01:36:08.705 --> 01:36:28.705\nAnd I think that's phenomenal, right? If we can use AI personalized\nlearning to expand a learner's curiosity and understanding and actually\nthen help teachers to focus on what they know how to do best, which is\nsupporting teacher supporting their learners and where they are\nstruggling. And so that's also another very exciting area on person.\n354 \"Obum Ekeke\" (99848192)\n01:36:28.705 --> 01:36:48.705\nAnalyze learning and one to one tutorium. AI could play a very critical\nrole here. But beyond technology, we also need to help teachers build\ntheir knowledge and confidence and skills around understanding what AI is\nand Bob, you asked me what was AI, you know, teachers need to be equipped\nwith what what's.\n355 \"Obum Ekeke\" (99848192)\n01:36:48.705 --> 01:37:22.325\nIs this thing called AI, what is machine learning, what are the\nimplications of machine learning in society? What can AI do in society?\nSo interestingly, we at google Deep Mind have partnered with the\nRaspberry Pie Foundation and created a set of learning resources and\nvideos and slides, hands on activities that help teachers to understand\nwhat AI is and how they can bring AI to the classroom as a tool, but also\nmost importantly, how they can teach.\n356 \"Obum Ekeke\" (99848192)\n01:37:22.325 --> 01:37:41.805\nTheir learners fundamentally what machine learning is and help them to\nbuild their problem solving skills and creativity. And we call this\nprogram experience AI and I will drop the link on the, on the chart.\nExperience AI is not about how to use AI as a tool, but how to.\n357 \"Obum Ekeke\" (99848192)\n01:37:41.805 --> 01:38:01.805\nAnd to actually have that foundational understanding of what AI is to\nhelp learners become more problem solving oriented and become more\ncreative and then play a role in I think that was at the beginning of the\nconversation it was mostly around digital skills. Be able to have that\nthose skills.\n358 \"Obum Ekeke\" (99848192)\n01:38:01.805 --> 01:38:29.796\nThese two skills or AI skills, the need in this in this AI enabled future\nthat we, we, we, we are going into. So again, what we are rolling that\nout globally in Kenya, we already have a number of teacher training\n Wednesday : Digital skills and resources -Transcript\nworkshops is expanding in Kenya, expanding in Nigeria, and we continue to\ncome to many countries. Teachers in over 01:30 countries are already\nusing experienced AI too.\n359 \"Robert J. Hawkins\" (4077986560)\n01:38:29.796 --> 01:38:50.285\nSo so what I hear is that we have opportunities to accelerate lesson\nplanning and we have opportunities to personalize learning and we have\nopportunities to develop relevant skills. And we talked a lot about these\nskills.\n360 \"Robert J. Hawkins\" (4077986560)\n01:38:50.285 --> 01:39:09.975\nI'm also worried about some of the downsides of AI. What, what, what are\nthe what are the risks that we're facing as a ministry? The other day my\nmy son was supposed to write a paper and he went to chat GPT and then the\npaper, he wrote the paper for him.\n361 \"Robert J. Hawkins\" (4077986560)\n01:39:09.975 --> 01:39:29.975\nI'm concerned that if we lose the art of writing, we lose the art of\nthinking. We cannot outsource thinking to computers. So I want you to\nthink about that, but I've noticed that we have another colleague from\nMicrosoft who's joined us. I I think she's in an airport somewhere.\n362 \"Robert J. Hawkins\" (4077986560)\n01:39:29.975 --> 01:39:57.456\nAdena. And Dina I have a question for you if you're able to connect. Is\nthis challenge that we've discussed before around learning poverty and\nwhether there's any role for AI to be able to accelerate early grade\nreading in a more effective manner than what we're, what we're facing\nright now in our classrooms where one poor teacher is trying to teach\nreading to 30 4050 students. Dina.\n363 \"Robert J. Hawkins\" (4077986560)\n01:39:57.456 --> 01:40:06.304\nBack, can you introduce yourself and share a little bit about your\nperspective on the potential of AI for early grade reading?\n364 \"Dina Ghobashy\" (3652646400)\n01:40:06.304 --> 01:40:24.106\nThank you. Thank you Bob and and thanks everybody for having me today.\nIt's exciting to be talking about AI and and its potential. Look we all\nknow that the the pandemic didn't really uncover.\n365 \"Dina Ghobashy\" (3652646400)\n01:40:24.106 --> 01:40:44.106\nEh, new problems. It's it's challenges that that we've had in our\neducation systems worldwide the the ratio of student to teacher and the\ndependency on the teacher and a lot of the the progress of students and\ntheir ability to to learn.\n366 \"Dina Ghobashy\" (3652646400)\n01:40:44.106 --> 01:41:07.266\nAnd acquire competencies, really makes it such that individualizing\nlearning or personalizing learning as the gentleman who was talking about\n Wednesday : Digital skills and resources -Transcript\nearlier, is, is really difficult. And I think this is this is a a great\nspace for technology and artificial intelligence in particular to really\nhelp accelerate that in.\n367 \"Dina Ghobashy\" (3652646400)\n01:41:07.266 --> 01:41:38.136\nCan enable students to take some ownership of their learning and be able\nto do some independent practice on their own using artificial\nintelligence to provide that immediate feedback. As we know from\nresearch, immediate feedback and timely feedback is extremely critical in\nmaking improvement and learning outcomes. So if we can give this to\nstudents at the pace that they need to to continue to make progress, then\nthat would completely accelerate their learning. We've seen this and I'm\ngonna speak from Microsoft experience.\n368 \"Dina Ghobashy\" (3652646400)\n01:41:38.136 --> 01:41:56.896\nAt this point, at, at Microsoft, we have a tool called reading progress,\nreading coach. That is exactly that. It's an AI powered tool. The control\nis all within the teacher's hands. Teachers assign reading material to\nstudents, but they can practice it as often as they want.\n369 \"Dina Ghobashy\" (3652646400)\n01:41:56.896 --> 01:42:16.896\nAnd teacher can provide different content to different students, and the\nAI actually provides the feedback to students. So we do have an impact\nstudy that showed that it has improved learning outcome and that the\nlearning outcomes increase, are even higher with students that.\n370 \"Dina Ghobashy\" (3652646400)\n01:42:16.896 --> 01:42:37.596\nThat are underserved in their schools and we've even noticed in some\ncases that the some kids were misdiagnosed with dyslexia or learning\ndifferences when really what they were going through was anxiety having\nto speak and read in front of the whole class being put on the spot,\nbeing corrected.\n371 \"Dina Ghobashy\" (3652646400)\n01:42:37.596 --> 01:42:58.742\nBy teachers in front of their peers, so when you take all of this away\nand you have the artificial intelligence, you know, nicely and gently\ntelling them, oh, that was a mistake and you try it again and then giving\nthem kudos forgetting it right, it really builds up their confidence and\nand develops those early readers that that we all aspire.\n372 \"Robert J. Hawkins\" (4077986560)\n01:42:58.742 --> 01:43:15.436\nTo develop. Thank you, thank you Dina. No I think I think this these\nlessons were still at the very early stages of learning and again I, I\nstress just as we're asking our teachers to be learners, we, all of us at\nthe United Republic of learning.\n373 \"Robert J. Hawkins\" (4077986560)\n01:43:15.436 --> 01:43:35.436\nNeed to be learners as well. And this is a prime example of how we are\nall learning together how this new technology might be able to support us\n Wednesday : Digital skills and resources -Transcript\nas well as some of the risks that we need to be aware of. Maybe open one\nlast comment before we open the floor on any.\n374 \"Robert J. Hawkins\" (4077986560)\n01:43:35.436 --> 01:43:49.087\nOne or two recommendations for these policy makers to think about with\nregard to policy around AI, and then I'll ask you Dina the same question,\nbut please make it very short, just one or two recommendations.\n375 \"Obum Ekeke\" (99848192)\n01:43:49.087 --> 01:44:15.906\nYeah, I think in terms of and I'm I must say I'm not a policy as part,\nbut in terms of policy, one of the things that is usually top of mind is\naround the ethics of AI, making sure that whatever we are doing in AI,\nwhoever is doing it is on, has the understanding and is applying ethical\nconsiderations in AI so that this will be.\n376 \"Robert J. Hawkins\" (4077986560)\n01:44:15.906 --> 01:44:34.009\nIf you were a school teacher with access to AI, would you encourage your\nstudents to use AI or would you, what would you tell your students with\nregard to the ethics of AI? Is it important that if they use AI they\nshould tell you?\n377 \"Obum Ekeke\" (99848192)\n01:44:34.009 --> 01:44:57.592\nHow how would you approach this as a teacher in a classroom? I think for\nstu for teachers specifically, if I wear a teacher, some of the things\nthat I will highlight to students is the point you mentioned earlier\nearlier about overlay reliance on AI, right? So AI is a tool and and\nhuman beings, we as human beings shouldn't over rely on, on them and.\n378 \"173.243.2.68\" (3635145728)\n01:44:57.592 --> 01:45:00.671\nNo.\n379 \"Obum Ekeke\" (99848192)\n01:45:00.671 --> 01:45:16.966\nYeah, so around the other thing I will highlight is around\nmisinformation. There is this thing called hallucination in AI. AI is not\na hundred percent accurate in some cases.\n380 \"Obum Ekeke\" (99848192)\n01:45:16.966 --> 01:45:33.752\nAnd because it's trained on data that already exists, so they also\ninstances where we've seen AI has had lucinating and then bringing out\nthe wrong information. So again, that's something to be mindful of not to\nrely on AI. I think those are some of the.\n381 \"Robert J. Hawkins\" (4077986560)\n01:45:33.752 --> 01:45:52.056\nThe areas I would instantly highlight. No, thank you Obama. Yeah, some,\nsome describe AI as a very smart graduate student when he or she does not\nknow the answers gives you a beats answer and make something up. Although\nillucination might be.\n Wednesday : Digital skills and resources -Transcript\n382 \"Robert J. Hawkins\" (4077986560)\n01:45:52.056 --> 01:46:12.056\nA feature of AI because it it generates creativity and responses that\nmaybe otherwise would not emerge from. The other point that you made that\nI think is very important is that it's trained on existing data, and what\ndo our colleagues need to think about?\n383 \"Robert J. Hawkins\" (4077986560)\n01:46:12.056 --> 01:46:28.276\nWrap up.\n384 \"Dina Ghobashy\" (3652646400)\n01:46:32.571 --> 01:46:52.146\nSorry. So I think one of them is to really adopt and reinforce some of\nthese ethical responsible AI policies around inclusivity, transparency,\nsecurity, privacy, all of these important responsible a.\n385 \"Dina Ghobashy\" (3652646400)\n01:46:52.146 --> 01:47:12.146\nAI, not just in the use, but also in the development of them. As as we're\nseeing now there is demonstratization of software development. A lot of\npeople could really leverage artificial intelligence now to create their\nown tools that use those llmiss or small language models also to develop\ntools for other.\n386 \"Dina Ghobashy\" (3652646400)\n01:47:12.146 --> 01:47:36.996\nTo use so I think how can policymakers really enforce that all new\ndevelopment as well adheres to some of these ethical AI practices. The\nother thing in those schools, I think, I think I think we need to give\nthe opportunity for teachers to really leverage artificial intelligence.\nIt's very easy to say NO, we're not gonna use it, but the students.\n387 \"Dina Ghobashy\" (3652646400)\n01:47:36.996 --> 01:48:03.816\nSo using it as your son did. Bob, I'm pretty sure that his teacher didn't\nask him to. But we're starting to see that the more teachers are playing\naround with artificial intelligence, they then acquire a sense of it of\nwhen to use it and when not to use it. There is an opportunity we've seen\nin an education system in Australia where we're engaging with they\ndecided they were gonna give AIT younger students and then have.\n388 \"Dina Ghobashy\" (3652646400)\n01:48:03.816 --> 01:48:23.816\nOf the teacher work with the students on the critical thinking part. What\ndid you see the AI tell you? Do you think this was the correct answer?\nWhat should you do now in order to get validated? So they're actually\nusing it for information literacy in addition to also supporting students\nand getting them used to the tool of the future.\n389 \"Dina Ghobashy\" (3652646400)\n01:48:23.816 --> 01:48:40.636\nAnd we're also seeing practices in paired education. So we've actually\nseen some of the teachers wouldn't in faculty once they started getting\n Wednesday : Digital skills and resources -Transcript\nreally comfortable with artificial intelligence saying, you know what,\nyou could use AI to write papers. I think this is revolutionary thinking,\nbut.\n390 \"Dina Ghobashy\" (3652646400)\n01:48:40.636 --> 01:49:00.636\nThere is a certain limit to how much AI you could use and they have a\ndetection tool that the faculty to tell how much AI was actually used in\nthe, in the paper, and there's this agreement between the professor and\nthe students that you could use it to help you a little bit shape your\nthinking perhaps the.\n391 \"Dina Ghobashy\" (3652646400)\n01:49:00.636 --> 01:49:14.914\nYou should be able to defend and argue whatever's in the paper and it\nshouldn't exceed a certain amount of artificial intelligence used. I need\nto see some of your own work as a student. So that's an interesting and\nkind of.\n392 \"Robert J. Hawkins\" (4077986560)\n01:49:14.914 --> 01:49:42.626\nThis is perfect because it brings us back, you weren't with us at the\nbeginning, but it brings us back to where we started this conversation\naround what are the skills that we need to teach our students to be\nprepared for an ever changing and uncertain future, and we and we talked\nabout critical thinking of being critical consumers of information, of\nbeing problem solvers, of using technology and our knowledge to solve\nreal problems.\n393 \"Robert J. Hawkins\" (4077986560)\n01:49:42.626 --> 01:50:11.406\nAnd of of being creators of of thinking differently and using tools to\nexpand our our our creativity. And the role of teachers is going to need\nto change to begin to engage with students around the development of the\nskills and development of their own skills. So I I think we're out of\ntime on our all ministry meeting, but it's been a fascinating discussion.\nThank you for all of the colleagues for the debrief.\n394 \"Robert J. Hawkins\" (4077986560)\n01:50:11.406 --> 01:50:28.736\nTo to me as minister, we will take this. And again, I hope that we are\nincorporating it into our action plans as we begin to develop what we\nwant to do to execute our strategies and policies around the use of of\nEdTech. Lucia, let me pass to you for the unenvivaable task.\n395 \"Lucia Dellagnelo\" (144154368)\n01:50:28.736 --> 01:50:50.796\nThank you minister. Yeah, I have a really challenging task today because\nit was such a rich discussion. But I think we started by asking why and I\nthink it's a very important question for policy makers. What changes do\nwe want to see in our schools with teachers and students with.\n396 \"Lucia Dellagnelo\" (144154368)\n Wednesday : Digital skills and resources -Transcript\n01:50:50.796 --> 01:51:10.796\nDigital skills and with access to high quality digital resources. So what\nis our vision for the changes that we want to see in our education, in\nour skills? Then the 2nd important point is that it's very important\nregarding digital skills to have a framework to make.\n397 \"Lucia Dellagnelo\" (144154368)\n01:51:10.796 --> 01:51:30.796\nMake sure that we have a common understanding of the knowledge, the\nvalues, the attitudes we want to promote both for students and teachers\nin terms of digital skills. And, we were reminded that when we talk about\ndigital skills, we are not only talking about technical.\n398 \"Lucia Dellagnelo\" (144154368)\n01:51:30.796 --> 01:51:50.796\nAbilities or skills but also social emotional skills to be able to use\ntechnology in a critical responsible and ethical way. And these\nframeworks and and Barbara gave us examples of many frameworks that were\ndeveloped at the global level, but it's important also to look at.\n399 \"Lucia Dellagnelo\" (144154368)\n01:51:50.796 --> 01:52:06.346\nThe local level to to each country and see if the the frameworks are\nusing a language that reflects the, the, the common the local customs,\nthe local practices in schools, but there are.\n400 \"Lucia Dellagnelo\" (144154368)\n01:52:06.346 --> 01:52:26.346\nFrameworks for teachers and for students and for students we we always\nthink that frameworks should include the three C's, the ability to\ncommute to use technology, to consume technology, but to communicate and\nand and connect with technology and create technolog.\n401 \"Lucia Dellagnelo\" (144154368)\n01:52:26.346 --> 01:52:46.346\nWe don't want our students only to be consumers of technology but really\nfew agency and confidence to create new technology to solve personal but\nsocial and community problems. And regarding to teachers, we need\nframework that includes skills pathogological skills.\n402 \"Lucia Dellagnelo\" (144154368)\n01:52:46.346 --> 01:53:13.206\nTeaching with technology assessments with technology, preparing lesson\nplanning with technology, but also more like a digital citizenship skills\nto, to think about safety, cyber security responsible use of technology\nfor themselves and to teach their students and how to use technology for\ntheir professional development. So we have to make sure that the.\n403 \"Lucia Dellagnelo\" (144154368)\n01:53:13.206 --> 01:53:33.206\nFrameworks that we use include skills, values, and attitudes in all these\nobjectives. For students we need to make sure as policymakers that we\ninclude digital skills international curriculum age by age, trying to\nidentify what kind of skills.\n Wednesday : Digital skills and resources -Transcript\n404 \"Lucia Dellagnelo\" (144154368)\n01:53:33.206 --> 01:54:07.836\nAre important for each age group because they are different from primary\nto secondary and to the to develop teachers digital skills, we need to\nhave different strategies. One is to incorporate digital skills in their\ninitial training, so making sure that the curriculum at the education\ncollege include digital skills, but we also need to provide peer learning\nopportunities and the opportunity for teachers to be engaged in the\nproduction of digital content and.\n405 \"Lucia Dellagnelo\" (144154368)\n01:54:07.836 --> 01:54:37.656\nReally have communities of learning where they can build the skills and\nthe confidence necessary to use technology for teaching and learning. And\nregarding digital resources, we discussed that they need to be\ninteractive, high quality, and provide data about the learners to be able\nto personalize their learning experience. So and to teach at the right\nlevel. So it's not about only to.\n406 \"Lucia Dellagnelo\" (144154368)\n01:54:37.656 --> 01:54:57.656\nDigitalize our printed materials that we have in our our our countries,\nbut being able to invest time and resources in developing high quality\ndigital resources. Teachers can and should be involved in developing\nthese resources, these learning resources, but we also have to.\n407 \"Lucia Dellagnelo\" (144154368)\n01:54:57.656 --> 01:55:17.656\nInvolve instructional designers, technologies, other people with\ndifferent expertise to make sure that we are producing and using all the\npotential of technology in terms of producing ah good and high quality is\neasily accessible digital.\n408 \"Lucia Dellagnelo\" (144154368)\n01:55:17.656 --> 01:55:37.656\nResources. Another thing that we have to think about in our policies is\nthe distribution, the access of these digital resources. We have to have\noffline solutions to make sure that all teachers and students in our\nsystem will be able to access this digital resources.\n409 \"Lucia Dellagnelo\" (144154368)\n01:55:37.656 --> 01:56:02.286\nAnd organize the content in very well designed learning platforms that\nteachers can use that easily can access the the materials and the content\nthey need for their planning and and their lessons and also families and\nstudents can use. And the last but not the least, we discussed a little\nbit about artificial intelligence.\n410 \"Lucia Dellagnelo\" (144154368)\n01:56:02.286 --> 01:56:22.566\nThe potential for helping and and the impact it's going to have in\neducation. We cannot deny, we cannot band the use of artificial\nintelligence in our schools, but we can harness its potential to help\nlesson planning, content to.\n411 \"Lucia Dellagnelo\" (144154368)\n Wednesday : Digital skills and resources -Transcript\n01:56:22.566 --> 01:56:42.566\nCreation, personalized learning with one to one tutoring. There are these\nartificial intelligence tutors now that can help every student. Something\nthat is very difficult for teachers to do in large classes classes, but\nnow we have these tutors that can help, help each student.\n412 \"Lucia Dellagnelo\" (144154368)\n01:56:42.566 --> 01:57:02.566\nIn their learning process and and that it's very important that teachers\nthat they understand what is artificial intelligence to be able to\nincorporate in their teaching practice. So we have to invest in the\ntraining of teachers for them to really understand what is artificial\nintelligence and.\n413 \"Lucia Dellagnelo\" (144154368)\n01:57:02.566 --> 01:57:22.566\nAnd how can AI can augment, can help to expand their role, and their\nrole, as we discussed is not what it used to be just to transmit\nknowledge, just to give content, but it's also to be this tutor, this,\nand.\n414 \"Lucia Dellagnelo\" (144154368)\n01:57:22.566 --> 01:57:49.036\nAnd Bob said something the minister, the minister said something about\nlove, about engaging students in the learning experience. So, but there\nare risks associated with AI and the use of AI in education that\npolicemakers need to be aware of. We have the ethics of AI, we have the\nrisk of AI reproducing prejudices and.\n415 \"Lucia Dellagnelo\" (144154368)\n01:57:49.036 --> 01:58:09.036\nThe Misinformation hallucinations that can, really give wrong information\nto our teachers and students. But then I think the most important part\nand it has to do with digital skills is being able to to be critical\nusers of AI. We have to develop.\n416 \"Lucia Dellagnelo\" (144154368)\n01:58:09.036 --> 01:58:29.676\nTo ourselves policymakers, but for teachers and students, these skills\nthat they need to interact with AI and being able to judge and to select\nwhat things AI can contribute for their learning experiences and what\nthings we don't want.\n417 \"Lucia Dellagnelo\" (144154368)\n01:58:29.676 --> 01:58:49.676\nTo use AI for, we don't want to substitute this human contact contact of\neducation. So I think these are very important pillars of the policy both\ndigital skills and digital resources. We connect.\n418 \"Lucia Dellagnelo\" (144154368)\n01:58:49.676 --> 01:59:18.346\nActing with our discussion of yesterday, there is NO, it makes NO sense\nto have infrastructure if we don't have teachers and students knowing how\nto use this infrastructure and if we don't have high quality digital\nmaterials that can improve and address the learning crisis that we have\nin all of our countries. So I hope that I, I I did.\n Wednesday : Digital skills and resources -Transcript\n419 \"Lucia Dellagnelo\" (144154368)\n01:59:18.346 --> 01:59:38.346\nA good summary of everything that was discussed.

My name is Changha.\nBy this point, you have likely received numerous emails from me – apologies for the email\nbombardment over the last couple of weeks! I want to welcome you all to the launch of the Tey\nAcademy. We are joined today by representatives from nearly 20 countries, currently at 19, and\nwe are expecting almost 200 people to connect across Africa.\nSince we have a large group on this call, I would ask everyone to please mute their microphones.\nI will mute a few participants who may not have done so. This event is currently being\ninterpreted into both English and French. If you prefer to listen in French, please look for the\nglobe icon at the bottom left of your screen. Sarah will post instructions in the chat on how to\nselect your preferred language.\nTo officially begin, I would like to invite Mr. Peter Matu from the MasterCard Foundation to\nshare some opening remarks. Following Peter, we’ll hear from our Practice Manager at the\nGlobal Unit of the World Bank, Hal. So, over to you, Peter.\"\n---\n**Peter Matu’s Opening Remarks**\n\"Thank you, Changha. Good afternoon to all our distinguished guests, partners, and participants.\nThank you for setting aside time to be here with us today. It’s a pleasure to join this event, which\nreflects the partnership between MasterCard Foundation and the World Bank. I’m particularly\ninspired by the presence of government leaders here as we discuss ways to create resilient\neducation systems.\nLast year, around 12 countries participated in the academy, and this year we’re excited to see\nover 15 countries involved. This growth highlights the importance of our mission. MasterCard\nFoundation envisions a world where every young person, regardless of background, can learn\nand succeed. In 2018, we launched Young Africa Works, a strategy aimed at enabling 30 million\nyoung people, especially women, across Africa to access dignified and fulfilling work by 2030.\nThrough this strategy, we aim to strengthen institutions and systems essential to sustaining\nthese outcomes.\nWe implement our strategy across Africa through seven offices in Ethiopia, Ghana, Kenya,\nNigeria, Rwanda, Senegal, and Uganda, with a strong commitment to inclusivity. We focus on\nsupporting economically disadvantaged youth, those in difficult-to-reach situations, women,\nand people with disabilities, refugees, and displaced persons. We meet young people where\nthey are—from education and skill development to connecting them to job opportunities, and\nwe emphasize expanding opportunities in the labor market, particularly through\nentrepreneurship.\nAfrica is at a unique demographic moment. If we take appropriate action, the continent’s\nworkforce could be a great asset. By 2050, one in four people born worldwide will be African.\nEach year, countless young people enter the labor market, but only a fraction find wage\nemployment. With populations in other regions declining, Africa’s working-age population is\nprojected to grow from 370 million in 2010 to roughly 600 million by 2030. We at MasterCard\nFoundation view this as a chance to empower Africa’s youth to seize opportunities.\nLaunch event -Transcript\nOur workforce development and entrepreneurship initiatives are cornerstones of our work\nthrough 2030 and beyond. Digital skills are critical to Africa’s development. At recent summits\nin Tanzania and Nigeria, African leaders emphasized that digital skills are vital, not only for\neconomic growth but also for social inclusion and human capital development. This shared\nvision sets a call to action.\nThrough the MasterCard Foundation’s Center for Innovation in Teaching and Learning, our\npartners work to support governments in scaling resilient education systems. This collaboration\nwith the World Bank aims to help countries establish hybrid education systems that will arm\nyoung people with future-ready skills. As we move forward, technology’s role will be key—not\nas a replacement for traditional classrooms, but as an augmentation.\nBuilding 100,000 new classrooms annually and recruiting millions of teachers is not feasible.\nHybrid systems that incorporate technology can help address this gap. Embracing technology is\nessential for expanding access to quality education, especially with the age of artificial\nintelligence and big data upon us. Africa can and must be part of this new era. Let’s empower\nour young people and communities to thrive within it.\nThank you once again for the opportunity to share this vision. Over to you, Hal.\"\n---\n**Hal’s Remarks**\n\"Thank you, Peter, and thank you to my colleagues, Bob, Alex, Changha, and the team for\norganizing this important event. This is the second event in this series, following one last spring\nin partnership with MasterCard Foundation. We are thrilled to bring together policymakers from\naround 20 countries to address educational challenges and opportunities.\nAcross the region, we recognize there are significant challenges in education, but there is also a\ntremendous opportunity if we act now. Many countries here have already developed ambitious\nstrategies targeting both learning poverty and youth skill development. The digital skills\ncomponent is crucial, and we are addressing this through programs and projects across regions.\nWe aim to build skills and facilitate knowledge exchange, drawing from successful regional\nexamples.\nOur Education Policy Academy, designed as a learning experience, brings countries together to\nstudy educational technology policies, analyze regional data, and identify ways to use digital\nskills to drive economic growth and reduce poverty. We hope this experience will enable\nparticipants to build on these lessons and develop future-forward programs.\nOur teams are here to support you as we identify critical skill areas. I encourage everyone to\nengage actively, ask questions, and exchange information over the next few weeks. This is an\nopportunity to foster collaboration, shape programs, and design policies that create resilient\neducation systems. Thank you, and back to you, Changha.\"\n---\n**Changha’s Closing and Introduction to the Academy**\nLaunch event -Transcript\n\"Thank you, Hal. Alongside the MasterCard Foundation, we also appreciate the partnership with\nFCDO. Rachel Hinton from FCDO was unable to join us today due to a scheduling conflict, but we\nare grateful for their support.\nNow, I’d like to walk you through a brief introduction to the 2024 Tey Academy for Africa. These\nslides should look familiar to many of you who participated in the onboarding, but I want to\nprovide an overview. The Tey Academy is a capacity-building program, not only for bank staff\nbut also for government officials from partner countries. Its goal is to enhance skills and\nknowledge in educational technology, with a particular focus this year on implementing EdTech\npolicies developed last year.\nParticipants are divided into country teams, working over the next three weeks to develop\nprojects with guidance from instructors. Throughout these weeks, you’ll refine a roadmap in\ncollaboration with your team, based on goals specific to your country. Hal already mentioned\nthe main objectives for this year: analyzing last year’s policies, sharing knowledge across\ncountries, and prioritizing specific gaps in EdTech implementation. A crosscutting theme for this\nacademy is the role of AI, which will be discussed in panels throughout the week.\nDuring this week, we’ll hold panel discussions where each country team can share lessons\nlearned, including challenges and successes, since the previous academy in spring 2023.\nDuring week two, you’ll engage in discussions with your country team, focusing on the next steps\nand strategies for implementing the technology policy developed in previous iterations. Once\nyou complete work on your country teams’ roadmap, there will be an opportunity to present in\na plenary session. Here, you’ll share your presentations with other participating countries from\nthe EIC Policy Academy. We’ll hold two sessions for this: one in English and one in French, with\nlinks to be shared as we get closer to those dates.\nLearning Hours and Certification Requirements\nAcross the three weeks, the estimated learning time ranges between 10 to 15 hours, with the\nbulk of these hours during the week you meet with other countries for panel discussions. To be\neligible for certification, you are required to post at least one portfolio entry per week. We will\nshare more information about the platform later in this session, as Sarah will provide a\nwalkthrough.\nPanel Schedule and Topics\nFor tomorrow's panel, the topic will be \"Devices and Connectivity.\" On Wednesday, we will focus\non \"Digital Skills and Digital Resources\"; on Thursday, we’ll discuss \"EMIS and Implementation\nCapacity\"; and on Friday, there will be a special French session featuring Sahil Region countries\nand discussions under the Open Schools initiative. All panels will be held at the same hour each\nday, Tuesday through Friday.\nLaunch event -Transcript\nMeeting Links and Logistics\nTo reduce confusion, we have not yet circulated the meeting links; however, in today’s meeting\nlink text, you’ll find a link for tomorrow’s panel and links for the rest of the week. We’ll also send\nreminders, so please keep an eye out for updates. Feel free to ask any questions.\nOpening Remarks and Inviting Dr. Lucia Deelo\nI’ll now hand it over to Dr. Lucia Deelo, who will lead a panel with representatives from countries\nat the forefront of EdTech policy drafting. Lucia, over to you.\nLucia Deelo’s Introduction and Panel Purpose\nThank you, Shan. Good morning and afternoon to everyone. I am pleased to welcome you to\nthis session on the journey countries undertake to design and implement EdTech policies. Some\nof today’s presenting countries began their journey following participation in last year’s Policy\nAcademy, and we expect this group to leave with a solid roadmap, motivated to advance EdTech\npolicies in their countries. The goal of this session is not only to highlight successes but to reflect\non challenges and lessons learned, as policymaking is complex and dynamic. We are grateful to\nthe countries willing to share insights and recommendations for others starting their EdTech\npolicy processes.\nCountry Presentations and Key Questions\nWe’ve asked each presenter to introduce themselves, outline their position, and discuss:\nWhere they are in developing their EdTech policies.\nThe main steps undertaken.\nChallenges faced during the process.\nRecommendations for other countries starting this process.\nPresentation by Bella Riamba, Rwanda\nThank you, Lucia. Hello, everyone; I’m Bella Riamba, Chief Digital Officer at the Ministry of\nEducation in Rwanda. My responsibilities include overseeing the digital transformation of the\neducation sector, policy drafting, and strategic planning. Here’s an outline of Rwanda’s EdTech\npolicy journey:\nPolicy Update: We realized the need to update our ICT Education Policy from 2016, given the\nrapid evolution in technology. Rather than focusing solely on infrastructure, we broadened the\nscope to include partnerships with the private sector and EdTech companies.\nLaunch event -Transcript\nSupport and Collaboration: With support from the World Bank and the Mastercard Foundation,\nwe formed an internal task force with members from various universities, agencies, and\nministries to draft the first framework. This ensured the inclusion of relevant stakeholders from\nthe outset.\nChallenges and Recommendations: Time management was our main challenge. Policymaking\ninvolves multiple stakeholders, and aligning their schedules can be difficult. My advice to other\ncountries is to finalize technical drafts quickly, allowing more time for stakeholder review and\napproval. Engaging all stakeholders from the beginning accelerates the process, minimizes\nrevisions, and ensures smoother implementation.\nPresentation by Alard Alex Barab, Tanzania\nThank you, Lucia. Good morning and afternoon. I’m Alard Alex Barab, Chairperson of Tanzania’s\ntask force for the National Digital Education Strategy (2024-2030). Here’s a summary of our\njourney:\n• Situation Analysis: We conducted an analysis to assess current technology use across\nschools, universities, and vocational colleges, resulting in a report highlighting the need\nfor a national digital education strategy.\n• Policy Context: We reviewed national, regional, and international policy frameworks,\nincluding our e-Government Strategy and the African Union’s digital education strategy,\nto align with ongoing digital transformation efforts.\n• Current Status: The strategy document is complete and has been approved by the\nMinistry of Education management. After a national dialogue for stakeholder input in\nJune, we are now awaiting the official launch, expected soon.\n• Recommendations: Developing strategic frameworks early is essential as they guide the\nimplementation of digital education initiatives across the country.\nThe second recommendation is to have a highly inclusive team while developing this kind of\nstrategic document, so everyone can be included and represented in this exercise. Thank you\nvery much. Thank you, Cardo, for the insightful advice. Let’s move to Mulun from Ethiopia, who\nhas just developed a new EdTech policy. Mulun, could you share the lessons you’ve learned and\nyour recommendations for other countries?\nThank you, Luia. Good morning, good afternoon everyone, and thank you to the organizers for\ninviting me to share our experiences with our friends, countries, and governments. Our strategy\nhas been approved and is currently being implemented. The steps we went through involve\nthree main components: assessment, development, and evaluation and approval. We iterated\nthrough these components using various approaches. First, we built a group of experts from\ndifferent stakeholders. The purpose of the assessment was to understand the local context and\ndetermine what should be included in the strategy document.\nAs part of this, we assessed the local and regional policy frameworks, which provide general\nguidance. These frameworks also inspired us to begin crafting a digital strategy policy document.\nKey frameworks included the Ministry of UC training and education policy, which defines the\nLaunch event -Transcript\nministry’s mandate and authorities, helping us assess local challenges in the education sector\nand how EdTech can contribute to addressing them. Other frameworks included Ethiopia’s\nnational digital strategy, Digital Ethiopia 2025, which prioritizes education as a sector for\nnational digital transformation, and the African Union regional framework, which we used as\nfoundational guidance to inform our policy.\nWe also examined global and local tech trends, as well as practices implemented by\ndevelopment partners, neighboring developing economies, and developed countries. This\nanalysis helped us identify significant interventions and initiatives the government should\nconsider. In the development phase, our team developed the policy framework, with further\niterations between development, evaluation, and approval. The final strategy document was\napproved by the Ministry of Education’s leadership and His Excellency, the minister.\nDuring the evaluation phase, we used a variety of techniques. We organized small groups to\nprovide feedback on initial drafts, which we then refined based on their input. We also\nconducted larger group workshops with stakeholders who might be impacted by the policy.\nDevelopment partners, including the World Bank, Mastercard Foundation, and UNICEF,\nprovided valuable feedback, aiding in the document’s development.\nTo address challenges faced during both pre- and post-development phases, I would make some\nkey recommendations. Firstly, focus on addressing large-scale educational challenges like\naccess, inclusion, diversity, and quality. A holistic approach is essential since many components\nare interconnected; for example, technology availability requires user skills and data for\ndecision-making. Secondly, I recommend promoting open public goods, products, and services\nthat are developed incrementally, such as open content and open platforms. Use PL platforms,\nprioritize a coordinated approach, and avoid siloed initiatives. Start small, focus on progressive\ndevelopment, and set goals that push boundaries. Thank you, Lucia.\nThank you, Mulun, for sharing. Let’s now move to Jacob from Zimbabwe, who is currently\ndeveloping EdTech policies. Jacob, could you walk us through the steps you took and share your\nrecommendations for other countries?\nThank you, Lucia. Hello, everyone. I’m Jacob from Zimbabwe, and we’re currently in the process\nof developing our EdTech policy. Our journey began in 2016 with World Bank assistance led by\nDr. Tom Cassidy. We developed a draft ICT policy for education. Our first step was to create a\ntechnical working group, comprising members from the Department of ICT and e-learning, which\nis responsible for implementing ICT across the Ministry of Primary and Secondary Education.\nAfter forming the technical working group, we identified key representatives from other\ndepartments within the ministry and relevant sister ministries, including Higher and Tertiary\nEducation, Finance, ICT, and Justice. Together, these formed a larger steering committee. We\nbegan with consultations across schools nationwide, engaging stakeholders such as school\nleaders, parents, communities, and even students. After collecting input, we classified the\nfindings under thematic areas, focusing on infrastructure, capacity building, change\nmanagement, and sustainability.\nIn 2016, despite finalizing our draft, we struggled to secure funding to advance the policy.\nAdditionally, political shifts within the country necessitated a policy review. Earlier this year,\nwith renewed assistance from the World Bank, we updated the 2016 draft to align with current\nLaunch event -Transcript\nnational frameworks like the National ICT Policy, the Broadband Plan, and a new heritage-based\ncurriculum, which emphasizes innovation. We are currently consolidating these updates and will\npresent them to senior management.\nAs for recommendations, I would emphasize starting early and adhering to timelines. We initially\nplanned consultations in August when teachers were on break, but delays pushed these to\nSeptember and October, conflicting with exam season. Also, align policies with significant\nnational events that may drive necessary adjustments. In our case, we align the policy with the\nheritage-based curriculum’s seven-year cycle, which we review alongside the national ICT policy\nevery five years. Thank you, Lucia.\nThank you, Jacob, and to everyone for sharing your experiences. A common theme that emerges\nis the importance of timing—both technical and political considerations are essential to policy\ndevelopment. Dedicate adequate time for consultations with stakeholders and political\nnegotiations to secure policy approval. Coordination across strategies and avoiding silos are\ncrucial to transforming these policies into actionable outcomes for education. We’ll now\ncontinue with other sessions, with a view toward learning from each other and advancing our\nefforts to integrate technology in education.\nOver to you, CH or Bob, to lead from here. Thank you to all our panelists.\nNow, in this second phase, it’ll be very exciting. I see some of them connected, but we were not\nprepared to talk. If you allow me, Mr. Ahmed Bah, I’d like to give them the opportunity to share\na little bit. It’s a very dynamic team that continues to work closely together. We have very short\ntime; the president is calling me for another meeting soon, so we’ll have to wind up here in\nabout 15 minutes.\nAhmed, it’s wonderful to see you again; our paths crossed many years ago. Please say a few\nwords, and then I would like to call on Yogesh afterwards to share his reflections. Ahmed, over\nto you.\n[Music]\nUm, I’m going to give one minute to our colleague from Mauritius, Yogesh, to share a little bit\nabout data because we’ve touched upon the open school, which we will go into more depth on\nFriday. We’ve talked about digital infrastructure, which Ms. Bah just mentioned, and we’ve\ntouched briefly on digital skills, learning materials, and digital content. I want to hear more about\nthe challenges that you hope to address in the coming weeks regarding your data and systems.\nI wonder if you can share some reflections from Mauritius.\nYes, thank you, honorable Minister. For us, our story is as follows: since 2017, we’ve started a\nnew reform, and it was very important for us to provide technology to primary schools. We have\n257 primary schools in Mauritius where children were provided with tablets to enhance learning\nand use technology as leverage. You will understand that this required a lot of funding and also\nsignificant internal capacity to digitalize the curriculum.\nOur approach was more about partnership. We partnered with friendly countries like India and\nrevisited our local network with the Mauritius Institute of Education and the Mahatma Gandhi\nInstitute for Asian Languages, where we had a gargantuan task ahead of us to digitalize the\nLaunch event -Transcript\ncurriculum. As of now, Mauritius has been able to provide tablets to all its primary school\nstudents.\nWe have also catered for continuity in pedagogy during temporary school closures by hosting a\nrange of pedagogical videos in the cloud. The national TV, MBC, airs these video programs when\nschools are closed. We are also currently implementing an open educational resource policy that\ntouches on the primary, secondary, and tertiary subsectors. For the time being, we are busy\nimplementing Google Classroom, the fundamentals version, as the learning management\nsystem.\nThis requires us to be very strategic in our actions. What we are discussing is a strategic\norientation map to implement a TEEX strategy, which will be a unifying document. We are talking\nabout six strategic objectives to implement and clarify the way ahead of us. I’ll briefly outline\nthese strategic objectives:\n1. Reimagining the role of technology in education, thinking about how AI can help us.\n2. Engaging and empowering learning through technology, focusing on the learning side.\n3. Teaching with technology.\n4. Leadership: creating a culture and conditions for innovation and change.\n5. Assessment: measuring for learning.\n6. Infrastructure: enabling access and effective use of technology.\n7. Accountability: setting up a robust database for policy decisions and analytics.\nThat’s what we are thinking ahead in terms of EdTech policy. Thank you, Yogesh. This is very\npertinent because these are the themes that are emerging in each of your policies and\nstrategies.\nWhat we’ll focus on in the next few weeks is supporting all of us to expand these policies, which\nsometimes have to go to cabinet level, while the strategies that are more under our control, and\nimportantly, the action plan. We can’t do everything at once, and time is of the essence.\nAgain, I thank everybody for their reflections. As you know, I am not the best poet, and part of\nthe underlying theme of this event will be, as you all mentioned, reimagining education and the\nimportant role that AI and new technologies are playing.\nSo, FEI, welcome from Ghana. I must admit that at the end of our last session, I took the synopsis\nof the most important elements that came from each of your countries and asked my friend,\nChatGPT, to write a poem in the voice of Maya Angelou. This is what emerged: our beautiful\npoem that we ended our policy academy show with. I shared a prompt with you in the chat so\nthat you can see how I was engaging with my assistant, whom I call Maya, to help me write my\npoetry.\nWe will be learning more about AI as a cross-cutting theme all week. We’ll have colleagues from\nMasterCard Foundation, Microsoft, OpenAI, and hopefully Google DeepMind. I’m not sure if\nthey’re with us today, as well as a colleague from FCD, Sam, who will share perspectives on the\nimportance of AI.\nLaunch event -Transcript\nWhat I want to do now is to model how we might approach hybrid learning in our own countries.\nWe will have these types of synchronous sessions, but I encourage all of you to learn and use\nthe learning platform that we’re utilizing in the United Republic of Learning to ensure that all of\nus are sharing the best of our knowledge and ideas.\nI’d like to pass over to my colleague Sarah, who will provide a brief overview of the platform\nwe’ll be using over the next few weeks to share our experiences and delve deeper into\nknowledge when we don’t have the opportunity to be face-to-face.\nI must run soon, but I thank you all and want to assure you that time is of the essence. I’m not\nsure how much longer I will be in this post, but I hope I will make it to three weeks for us to\nfinish this policy academy.\nSo over to you, Sarah, for conclusive words.\nThank you so much, Sarah. This is the end of the launch event. Tomorrow, please make sure to\nconnect at the same hour. We will circulate the meeting link again. Tomorrow, we’ll talk about\nPanel One, which focuses on devices and connectivity. We’ve invited Tanzania, Kenya, and a\ncouple of other countries to share their experiences and challenges.\nSo be on the lookout for the invite, and we’ll connect together again at the same time tomorrow\nmorning or afternoon based on your time zone.\nSo, talk to you all tomorrow. Thank you so much for your time. Talk to you tomorrow. Bye-bye!\n[Various goodbyes]\nThank you, everyone. Bye-bye!",

                    "video_transcript": "Thursday - Transcript\nHello, and welcome back to our engaging discussions with the Minister of the United Republic\nof Learning, where we’re exploring key EdTech policy topics. Today, we’ll dive into three crucial\nareas for implementing EdTech policies. We’ve been strategizing around different pillars, and\nnow, we’re focusing on actionable steps and addressing some challenging issues necessary for\nsuccessful policy rollout.\nThe first topic we’ll cover is costing—estimating the budget required to effectively implement\nour planned activities and strategies. To turn our policies into reality, we need to understand\nour resource requirements, encompassing human resources, technical capacity, and financial\ninvestment. Policy development is about informed decision-making, setting priorities, and\nknowing how much we’ll need to make technology a reality in our schools. Our guest today,\nalongside the Minister, will discuss the costs and strategies involved.\nOur second topic centers on data. Data is essential not only for situation analysis in planning but\nalso for monitoring policy implementation. On day one, we discussed the importance of\ninfrastructure, such as tools for inventorying school resources, monitoring platform usage, and\ntracking devices. Today, we’ll explore how countries are leveraging educational management\ninformation systems (EMIS) to generate data that enhances efficiency and guides resource\nallocation toward innovation and technology.\nLastly, we’ll discuss implementation capacity. EdTech policies demand coordination across\nvarious domains, some beyond the Ministry of Education’s scope, like connectivity and digital\ninstructional material production. We’ll explore how ministries can prepare to ensure effective\npolicy implementation, examining global models. Some countries have built robust EdTech\ndepartments within their ministries, while others rely on dedicated agencies. Today, we’ll hear\nabout CENDLOS (Centre For National Distance Learning and Open Schooling), a Ghanaian agency\ncollaborating with the Ministry of Education to implement EdTech policies comprehensively.\nThese discussions are vital, and I’m sure our Minister will pose challenging yet necessary\nquestions to ensure effective policymaking. Over to you, Minister, to begin today’s conversation.\n________________________________________\nMinister: Good morning, everyone! Following yesterday’s discussions on AI and its educational\nrole, I realized I need a language tutor myself, so I’ve enlisted ChatGPT for some practice. I’m\nworking to make our United Republic of Learning more inclusive, given our linguistic diversity,\nwith over 2,000 languages spoken. This morning, I’ll attempt a few phrases with the help of my\n“language tutor.” Thank you for your patience as I work on this skill!\nToday, we’ll focus on costs, data, and organization. But first, let’s hear from Mohyedine on\ncosting. Mohyedine, could you outline your thoughts on estimating the budget for our EdTech\nstrategies?\nMohyedine: Thank you, Minister. Good morning, everyone. Regarding costing, there’s often a\nmisconception that implementing EdTech means purchasing devices like computers or tablets.\nInstead, we should focus on our objectives and select the most suitable tools accordingly. The\nbudgeting process is iterative; we revisit our categories—like content development,\ninfrastructure, and training—to ensure they align with our goals.\n Thursday - Transcript\nFor our project in Sahel, we used the Open School of India as a cost benchmark, which offers\nlow-cost education at around $10–$15 per student. This gave us a reference point, although\neach country’s context requires adjustments based on available resources like digital skills,\ninfrastructure, and connectivity.\nMinister: Excellent points, Mohyedine. Let’s unpack this further. You highlighted the importance\nof flexibility in selecting tools, identifying benchmarks like India’s Open School, and\ndifferentiating capital and operational expenses. Given our funding challenges, can you\nelaborate on these and share lessons from the Open School model?\nMohyedine: Certainly. India’s Open School model shows that scalable solutions don’t always\nrequire traditional teachers. Facilitators or tutors can guide students through self-paced\nlearning. This differs from the conventional model—building classrooms, hiring teachers—by\naddressing scalability issues critical in resource-limited contexts. In India, digital skills are\nwidespread, while in sub-Saharan Africa, this remains a challenge, so adaptation is key.\nMinister: Absolutely, the scalability of EdTech solutions is essential, especially with limited\nbudgets. Regarding operational versus capital costs, how do we manage future expenditures\nsustainably?\nMohyedine: Learning platforms and digital content are fixed costs, scalable to reach many\nstudents without extensive variable expenses. Devices for students are variable costs, which\ngrow with student numbers. The challenge is maximizing resources, so we should push variable\ncosts toward the fixed end where feasible. It’s a balance—ensuring scalability while planning for\nongoing operational costs.\nMinister: Thank you, Mohyedine. Let’s ensure everyone shares both costs and frameworks, so\nwe all gain insights across the United Republic of Learning.\n\"I think this is a very important point, and the work we're doing in the Sahel and surrounding\nregions through the Open School initiative is creating political space for us to innovate and do\nthings differently. This initiative encourages us to think outside the box and to implement new\nmethodologies in service delivery to reach out-of-school youth. I urge all of us to seize this\nopportunity to reimagine education for these youth by exploring novel approaches like the Open\nSchool. Often, the political environment makes it difficult to challenge the status quo. While the\ntraditional approach may seem safe, I encourage us to take calculated risks and be innovative.\nWithout such efforts, we will never reach all the students who currently lack access to education,\nlet alone those within the system who are not learning effectively.\n________________________________________\nTo truly improve learning outcomes, we need to ensure that students have more opportunities\neach day to engage with knowledge, connect with others, think, learn, create, and innovate. A\ncritical part of this is having accurate data. It’s frustrating that our ministry manages multiple\ndata systems, with nearly 20 separate databases that don’t communicate with one another. We\nhave data in silos across different sectors—such as our social registry and various private\nlearning management systems—that aren't integrated. As a result, we're not leveraging this\ndata in our daily decision-making processes.\n Thursday - Transcript\nMustapha, could you help us rethink our approach to organizing and utilizing our data systems?\nHow can we maximize their efficiency?\nThank you, Robert. Yes, I can hear you clearly. This is indeed a crucial question, especially in the\ncontext of Nigeria, where we must consider both the data itself and its utility. In my 17 years of\nexperience in educational information management systems, I've seen that the essential data is\nthe kind that aids planning and supports service delivery mechanisms. It's also data that we can\nanalyze over time to identify trends and evaluate impact. Often, we collect data at various\nstages—initially for situation analysis and theory of change, midway for tracking progress, and\nfinally for impact evaluation. Each stage may require additional or different data that we hadn’t\ninitially anticipated. In Nigeria, for example, the institutionalization of data generation has been\na vital process since 2005, when the education management information system was\nestablished. A robust data system requires clarity on data sources and stakeholder roles to\nensure accurate and actionable data.\nRobert, are there key questions we should be asking our system to provide insights on?\nCertainly. I would highlight three critical questions our system must address. First, is the data\ncollection aligned with our national education policy? Second, does the data give us insight into\nteacher capacity and needs? Third, does our data framework align with both the national\neducational management information system and the tech policy, particularly in infrastructure\nand human development? These alignments ensure that our data supports both internal goals\nand any external collaborations. Additionally, it's crucial to consider whether our data system\ncan identify where government resources should be directed, particularly for teacher\ndevelopment.\nThank you, Mustapha. It’s often the case that we collect data without questioning the purpose.\nI encourage everyone to think about the essential questions they need answered about our\nsystem. For instance, do we have an accurate count of teachers in each school? Do we know the\ncredentials of these teachers, and how frequently do we need updates to make informed\ndecisions—monthly, quarterly, or even daily?\n________________________________________\nAgatha, I’d like your input on what data countries should prioritize for collection. What’s\nessential?\nCertainly. When countries start collecting data, they need to focus on four areas. First, data\ncollection should align with national educational goals and policies. For example, if improving\ndigital literacy is a priority, then we must gather data on teacher and student access to devices.\nSecond, we need core educational metrics, such as student enrollment and teacher attendance,\nalong with data on teacher qualifications and workload. Third, infrastructure data is key—\nknowing which schools have electricity or internet access is fundamental before introducing\ndigital tools. Lastly, equity and inclusion data is crucial. If inclusive education is a policy goal,\nthen our systems should track students with special needs.\nUltimately, I would argue that the primary purpose of collecting data is to understand student\nlearning outcomes. Any data on teachers, infrastructure, or resources should contribute to the\ngoal of effective student learning. One of the most significant points raised here is around\ncapacity. We need to ask ourselves: do we have the capacity? Often, we invest in a system that\n Thursday - Transcript\nworks for a while, but then the person managing it is recruited by the private sector—\nsometimes even by companies like Microsoft. When that happens, the person who knows the\nsystem leaves, and we revert to a paper-based approach, sending surveys to directors and\nheadmasters and collecting them manually. I walk around the ministry and see boxes of paper\nsurveys, which one dedicated staff member was entering into an Access database. A year later,\nwe publish our national census. This is not the way to run a ministry, so we need to address this\nchallenge seriously.\n________________________________________\nNana, you’ve been working with CENDLOS on innovative ways to leverage capacity to meet the\nministry's objectives, particularly regarding technology and innovation. Could you share your\nexperience and perspective?\nNana:\nGood afternoon, everyone. I'm honored to be here to share our achievements at CENDLOS. I’m\nspeaking from Abuja, Nigeria, representing the Honorable Minister of Education. My name is\nNana Gyamfi Adwabour, Executive Director of CENDLOS, the Center for National Distance\nLearning and Open Schooling, under Ghana's Ministry of Education. Our mandate is to make\neducation accessible to every child in Ghana, regardless of location, gender, or ability.\nAt CENDLOS, effective planning is key to managing EdTech. We developed the EdTech\nImplementation Plan (EIP) framework for Ghana, focusing on human-centered design, equity,\naccessibility, and quality. Transitioning from traditional to online education requires significant\nattention to human development in the 21st century. Planning is crucial, from infrastructure to\ntraining, to ensure a smooth transition without losing sight of human-centered design.\nMinister:\nGreat. Nana, could you share one notable success and one major challenge encountered in\nimplementing this framework?\nNana:\nOur biggest success has been training teachers for online teaching, which was challenging at\nfirst, as many educators were resistant to digital tools. Through consistent training, however,\nthey have embraced this approach.\nOur main challenge, or “failure,” was in initial attempts to implement the system without fully\ninvolving teachers, particularly the \"BBCs\"—those born before computers. Some of these\nteachers are hesitant or even afraid to use digital tools, and while they possess valuable\nexperience, they often avoid EdTech resources. To address this, we’ve adapted training to meet\nthem at their level, providing basic ICT instruction to make the transition easier.\nMinister:\nThat’s crucial. Implementing change management to foster ownership is key. Thank you, Nana.\nFred, budget always comes up—what insights can you share?\n Thursday - Transcript\nFred:\nThank you. Around budgeting, there are four critical points. First, be realistic. UNICEF estimated\nit would cost $1.4 trillion over 10 years to digitize low- and middle-income countries, about $50\nper student annually. In Europe, it’s even higher at $500-$800 per student per year for mediumto high-range EdTech. Second, only invest in what you’ll use; ineffective spending on unused\ntechnology is widespread.\nThird, improve procurement processes. Ministries should secure spare parts, adequate\nequipment, and negotiate long-term licenses. Finally, maximize utilization. Many digital\nresources remain underutilized due to fragmentation and limited usage promotion.\n________________________________________\nMinister:\nThank you, Fred. Lucia, could you offer some closing thoughts on implementation?\nLucia:\nCertainly. Implementation capacity is key. While designing policies, it’s essential to consider the\nhuman and financial resources needed for successful execution. Also, define the educational and\npedagogical model clearly, as this shapes costs and role assignments. An EdTech policy needs\nchampions within the ministry—people dedicated to overseeing implementation, supporting\nschools, and ensuring the necessary technical expertise. Thank you all for a productive\ndiscussion. Remember to complete the reflection activity on the platform, and we look forward\nto tomorrow’s session.",

I want to wish you all a happy\nAll Saints' Day. I realize it's a public holiday in many parts of our United Republic of Learning, so\nthank you, Karen, Fred, for sharing your time with us today. I also know that afternoon prayers\nare approaching, so I’ll keep our closing brief.\nIt's been a fantastic week and a wonderful session today on the school of the future. During\nthese Ministry meetings, we’ve had the opportunity to share perspectives and ideas on how\nbest to leverage technology to meet our schools' current demands. As today’s discussion\nhighlighted, however, we have many young people out of school, and we need to use this\nopportunity—the school of the future and open schooling—to rethink our educational model to\nreach all these students.\nLet me share what I’ve prepared for our president at the United Republic of Learning. I’m\ncounting on all of you for your support in this effort. [Screen sharing] Can you see my screen?\nAudience: Yes, Mr. Minister, we can.\nMinister: Wonderful. I’ll run through this with you. Based on our discussions this week and what\nI’ve learned from all our debriefings, I’ve prepared a message for our president.\nAs you can see here, \"Your Excellency, after a week of convening the best educational innovators\nin our United Republic of Learning, I am pleased to present their valuable insights. I firmly believe\nin the urgent need to develop a comprehensive EdTech policy and action plan to equip all\nlearners with future-relevant skills, tools, infrastructure, and digital resources.\"\nI outline the main pillars of focus here, emphasizing that this policy will not only make our\neducation system more inclusive and resilient but will also equip future generations with\nessential digital skills for a knowledge-driven economy. I’m putting us—all of us—on the line\nwith our president.\nTo brief him on this week’s outcomes, we’re pulling together a task force to conduct a situational\nanalysis and stress the importance of a human-centered design approach. We aim to involve\nmultiple stakeholders in drafting and consulting on this policy. Our president is keen on costs\nand resources, so we’ll provide a clear budget outline. I’m committed to delivering a draft within\nsix months, reflecting the urgency we all feel.\nI’ve also provided him with a broad roadmap and framework for this strategy, which we’ll refine\nnext week, with a presentation planned for the following week. We’re on a tight timeline,\ncolleagues.\nKey elements discussed this week include infrastructure, digital skills, and engaging resources\nfor students—both in school and out of school. Today, we emphasized the need for creative\napproaches in hybrid models to foster student agency, engagement, and community support.\nOn infrastructure, we addressed issues like electricity, connectivity, offline solutions for rural\nstudents, and identifying appropriate devices. We’ll prioritize student access and emphasize our\ndigital skills framework, which outlines what skills we aim to teach, integrating them into\ncurricula, pre-service, and in-service teacher training. We’re focused on fostering innovative\n The message to the president - Transcript\npedagogical practices and digital citizenship among our teachers, reimagining their roles as\nmentors, facilitators, and community leaders.\nOn digital resources, we need to rethink engagement to make them relevant. Our goal is to\nintegrate these into national learning platforms, accessible across our United Republic of\nLearning. This will require a broad ecosystem of partners to help develop these resources.\nFinally, we discussed leveraging frontier technologies, such as AI, to enhance our efforts.\nMoving to the \"how,\" we need to understand the status of our schools and informal learning\nspaces, benchmark costs, and carefully manage data integration. Ultimately, we must leverage\nall skills and resources across the United Republic of Learning to achieve this vision.\nThe school of the future is essential for reaching those who are currently outside formal\neducation. I’ve committed us, as a Ministry, to develop this roadmap and report back to our\npresident within two weeks. Next week, we’ll be working intensively on this, with the following\nweek reserved for our report.\nThank you for all your hard work this week. I’m proud to work with you, but if we’re not\nsuccessful, these may be my final two weeks in office. So please, I depend on you to help deliver\nthe vision and mandate given to us by our president. Thank you, and I look forward to continuing\nour work over the coming weeks.\nAudience: Thank you, Minister.\nMinister: Thank you, everyone. Wishing you all a wonderful weekend.",
